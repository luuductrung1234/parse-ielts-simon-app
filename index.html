	<p>
				<p>As I'm sure you know, we normally place the adjective in front of the noun in English e.g. "the red car" instead of "the car red".</p>
<p>However, English is a crazy language, and rules are there to be broken!</p>
<p>If you read yesterday's lesson (and clicked on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postpositive_adjective">this link</a>), you may have seen the following examples of noun + adjective:</p>
<ul>
<li>someone important</li>
<li>somewhere nice</li>
<li>the best <em><strong>room available</strong></em></li>
<li>the only <em><strong>decision possible</strong></em></li>
<li>the worst <em><strong>choice imaginable</strong></em></li>
<li>the <em><strong>person responsible</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Remember:</strong> The 'rules' that you find in an intermediate (or even 'advanced') grammar book are probably a simplification. There are deeper levels to be discovered!<br></p>

	<h4><a href="https://www.ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2020/02/ielts-grammar-any-product-imaginable.html">IELTS Grammar: 'any product imaginable'</a></h4>
	<p>
				<p>There was an interesting discussion in the comments below Wednesday's <a href="https://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2020/02/ielts-writing-task-2-from-plan-to-paragraph.html">lesson</a> about the phrase <em><strong>"I can buy any product imaginable"</strong></em>.</p>
<p>Here's a summary of the questions in that discussion:</p>
<p>1) Why did I write <em><strong>any product <span style="text-decoration: underline;">imaginable</span></strong></em> instead of <strong><em>any</em> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">imaginable</span> product</strong>?<br>2) Would <em><strong>any imaginable product</strong></em> also be correct?<br>3) Is there a difference in meaning between the two phrases?</p>
<p>I'll try to answer without going deep into grammar, but if you really like the grammar side of things, have a look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postpositive_adjective">this page</a> (especially the part about 'the only decision possible' and 'the worst choice imaginable').</p>
<ol>
<li>The simple answer is that "any product imaginable" sounds better to me as a native speaker. This phrase isn't my own original creation; I've probably heard or read it many times in similar contexts, so it's the instinctive phrase to use.<br><strong>Note:</strong> There are 14,300 Google search results for this collocation.</li>
<li>While "any imaginable product" is also grammatically correct, it seems just a little less natural to me. The emphasis is slightly different, and the meaning could also be understood in a slightly different way.<br><strong>Note:</strong> There are only 905 Google search results for this collocation.</li>
<li>This is debatable. If I had to give you my view, I would say that an "imaginable product" could include products that don't currently exist (e.g. a flying car), whereas my phrase "any product imaginable" tends to refer to products that currently exist.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the end, the Google results and my instinct as a native speaker are probably your best guide. In normal English usage, "any product imaginable" is the typical collocation.</p>

	<p>
				<p>When you have written a plan, you then need to turn your notes into full sentences. Let's try this using the paragraph plan below.</p>
<p><strong>Paragraph plan:</strong></p>
<p>- High street shops are disappearing because of online stores.<br>- Online shopping is faster, cheaper and more convenient.<br>- People can sit at home, search for deals, receive delivery the next day.<br>- It is impossible for normal stores to compete with the range of choice.<br>- Personal example: recent purchases on Amazon.</p>
<p><strong>Full paragraph:</strong></p>
<p>In my opinion, high street shops are disappearing due to competition from online shopping websites, which are cheaper and more convenient. Web-based stores allow customers to search for the best deals, make purchases from the comfort of their homes, and receive delivery of their purchased items the next day. Furthermore, it is impossible for traditional bricks-and-mortar stores to compete with the range of choice that can be found online. For example, I recently used the website Amazon to buy some fairly rare academic textbooks that were not stocked at my local bookshop. As a customer, the fact that I can find any product imaginable online makes it almost pointless for me to make a trip to my local high street.</p>

	<p>
				<p>All students learn to link ideas using words like "however", "furthermore" etc. Most students don't realise that the word "this" is also a linking word. Look at the following examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nowadays, people can use the Internet to work from home. In <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">this</span> way, people who do not have access to transport can find employment.</li>
<li>Most products are built to last only a short time, and <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">this</span> creates a "throw-away" culture.</li>
<li>A global economy means free trade between countries. <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">This</span> can strengthen political relationships.</li>
</ul>
<p>The word "this" refers to the sentence or idea that came before. "This" helps you to link ideas and avoid repetition. Native speakers and good writers use "this" a lot, and the IELTS examiner will be impressed if you can use it.</p>

	<p>
				<p>There are three things that you need to think about when planning an essay:</p>
<ol>
<li>How you will <em><strong>answer</strong></em> the question (your position / opinion)</li>
<li>How you will <em><strong>structure</strong></em> your essay to communicate your answer</li>
<li>The <em><strong>ideas</strong></em> that you will include in your main paragraphs</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, let's do an essay plan for the question below.</p>
<p><em><strong>Many high street shops have gone out of business in recent years. Why do you think this has happened? Is it a positive or negative development?</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>1. My answer</strong></p>
<p>Online shopping is the main reason. The trend is both positive and negative.</p>
<p><strong>2. Structure: four paragraphs</strong></p>
<p>- Introduce the topic, and give a brief answer to both questions<br>- Main paragraph about online shopping<br>- Main paragraph about the positive and negative impacts<br>- Conclude by summarising the overall answer</p>
<p><strong>3. Ideas for the main paragraphs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Online shopping is faster, cheaper and more convenient. People can sit at home, search for the best deal, pay, and receive a delivery the next day. Impossible for stores to compete. Personal example: recent purchases on Amazon.</li>
<li>Positives: a world of choice, a solution for busy people or those who can't leave the house. Negatives: rising unemployment, loss of community as high streets become deserted.</li>

	<p>
				<p>I studied French at school for seven years, and my teachers helped me to accumulate quite a lot of <em><strong>knowledge about</strong></em> the language.</p>
<p>However, when I visited France I still felt like a beginner. I found it difficult to understand native speakers, and I couldn't speak naturally; I had to construct sentences in my head before I spoke, and I was constantly worried about making mistakes. In short, I had knowledge but <strong><em>not much skill</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Do you feel like this when you speak or write in English? Maybe it's time to stop <em><strong>studying</strong></em> English and start <em><strong>practising</strong></em> it as much as possible!</p>

	<p>
				<p>You won't have time to do this in your test, but it's a good idea to edit and improve the essays that you write at home.</p>
<p>For example, in the <a href="https://www.ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2020/01/ielts-writing-task-2-music-essay.html">music essay</a> that I shared on Wednesday, there's a phrase that we could improve: <strong>"the planet's global language"</strong>.</p>
<p>While this phrase is fine and wouldn't affect the essay's score, you could argue that it contains repetition because 'planet' and 'global' communicate similar meanings. Note: We could simply write "the planet's language" or "the global language", but I wanted to use this structure: noun + adjective + language.</p>
<p>So let's think about some possible alternatives:</p>
<ol>
<li>the planet's shared language</li>
<li>the planet's common language</li>
<li>humanity's global language</li>
<li>our global language</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice that I changed the adjective 'global' in the first two examples, I used a different noun (humanity) in example 3, and I used a pronoun instead of the noun 'planet' in example 4. Which alternative do you prefer?</p>

<p><em>Why do we use the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">past</span> tense (was hoping) if we're asking for help <span style="text-decoration: underline;">now</span>?</em></p>
<p><strong>Here's the answer that I gave the student:</strong></p>
<p>I know it seems strange, but this is a common way to ask for something in English. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>I was hoping that you could help me = I hope you can help me.</li>
<li>I was hoping to get your advice = Can you give me your advice?</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps you could think about it like this: the "hoping" happened in my head before I decided to ask for the help.</p>
<p>Or you could just see this as a fixed phrase, and a typically English way to ask politely and indirectly!</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here's my band 9 sample answer for the question below.</p>
<p><em><strong>Some people say that music is a good way of bringing people of different cultures and ages together. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?</strong></em></p>
<p>It is often said that music has the power to unite and connect people, regardless of their cultural backgrounds or ages. I completely agree with this view, and will give my reasons below.</p>
<p>Music can certainly reach across cultural and national boundaries and bring people together. Perhaps the best example of this would be the Live Aid concerts that took place back in the 1980s, and which were broadcast to a global audience. Two live events were held simultaneously in the UK and the US, and the objective was to raise funds for famine relief in Ethiopia. The concerts were a huge success, both in terms of the number of people around the world who watched them and their impact on international public awareness of the famine. They demonstrated, I believe, that music truly is the planet’s global language.</p>
<p>Just as it transcends cultures, music also has the ability to connect people from different generations. Regardless of age, we can all enjoy a memorable melody, a strong rhythm or a beautiful singing voice, and the best songs seem to have the same magical effect on all of us. This would explain why televised music competitions, such as ‘The X Factor’ or ‘The Voice’, are such popular prime-time shows. These programmes attract incredibly broad audiences because singing and popular songs appeal to children, parents and grandparents alike. I would argue that no other form of entertainment can bring families together in this way.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I believe that music is unique in its capacity to create shared experiences between people, irrespective of culture and age.</p>

If you want to improve your grammar score, stop worrying about 'complex structures'. Instead, work on gradually learning from your mistakes. Accuracy is more important, and more difficult, than structures.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Many students seem to think that the following is true:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">long, complex sentences = difficult = high score</p>
<p><strong><em>But this isn't necessarily correct</em></strong>. First, long sentences are just short sentences (or clauses) that have been linked together, so it's not difficult to write them. Second, you won't get a high score if your long sentences are full of mistakes.</p>
<p>The best writers use a mix of <em><strong>long and short</strong></em> sentences. This is the ideal style to aim for because it makes your writing 'smoother', more varied, and easier to read.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Let's look at what I call an 'example-led' paragraph. In this type of paragraph, we explain an opinion or develop an idea based on a single example.</p>
<p><strong>Paragraph topic: music connects people from different cultures</strong></p>
<p>Music can certainly reach across cultural and national boundaries and bring people together. <em><strong>Perhaps the best example of this would be</strong></em> the Live Aid concerts that took place back in the 1980s, and which were broadcast to a global audience. Two live events were held simultaneously in the UK and the US, and the objective was to raise funds for famine relief in Ethiopia. The concerts were a huge success, both in terms of the number of people around the world who watched them and their impact on international public awareness of the famine. They demonstrated, I believe, that music truly is the planet’s global language.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong></p>
<p>Notice how I introduce a key example after the topic sentence. In the rest of the paragraph, I simply describe the example in more detail, and I show how the example illustrates my point.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(You can read about the Live Aid concerts <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_Aid">here</a>)</span></p>

<li>Analyse <em><strong>one</strong></em> mistake in a reading or listening test, and understand why you got the answer wrong.</li>
<li>Learn <em><strong>one</strong></em> new word, collocation or phrase.</li>
<li>Learn how to express <em><strong>one</strong></em> idea in a 'natural' way. Find out how a native speaker would say it.</li>
<li>Prepare ideas, opinions and vocabulary for <em><strong>one</strong></em> IELTS topic.</li>
<li>Read <em><strong>one</strong></em> sample band 9 essay, and highlight anything useful e.g. vocabulary, cohesive devices, how ideas are developed.</li>
<li>Write <em><strong>one</strong></em> paragraph and get it checked by a teacher.</li>

	<p>
				<p>Here are my corrections for the sentences in yesterday's lesson.</p>
<p>1. "There are many reasons to believe why" is a clumsy phrase. Instead, write:</p>
<p>- There are many <em><strong>reasons why</strong></em> this is detrimental.<br>- There are many <strong><em>reasons why I believe that</em></strong> this is detrimental.<br>- I believe that this is detrimental for several reasons.</p>
<p>2. They have an impact on young <em><strong>adult<span style="text-decoration: underline;">s'</span></strong></em> health. (plural possessive)</p>
<p>3. We need to use the <em><strong>uncountable</strong></em> (not plural) form of the word <em><strong>exercise</strong></em>. We're talking about 'exercise' in general, not a specific number of exercises.</p>
<p>- The number of people doing physical <em><strong>exercise</strong></em> is falling.</p>
<p>4. "By spending hours on television" is a problematic phrase because "on television" is usually used when we're talking about the people who <em><strong>appear on</strong></em> TV. For example, if you say "I was on television yesterday", it means that you appeared on a TV programme. To avoid confusion, we need to write:</p>
<p>- By spending hours <strong><em>watching</em></strong> television...<br>- We lead a sedentary life because we spend so many hours <em><strong>watching</strong></em> TV.</p>

<li>Introduction: completely agree</li>
<li>Main paragraph: why music transcends cultures and age groups</li>
<li>Main paragraph: how music connects people</li>
<li>Conclusion: repeat / summarise</li>
</ol>
<p>But KiKi suggested an alternative plan, which I think is better:</p>
<ol style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; list-style-type: decimal; list-style-position: outside !important; caret-color: #000000; color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration: none;">
<li>Introduction: completely agree</li>
<li>Main paragraph: why music transcends or connects <span style="text-decoration: underline;">cultures</span></li>
<li>Main paragraph: how music connects different <span style="text-decoration: underline;">age</span> groups</li>
<li>Conclusion: repeat / summarise</li>
</ol>
<p>KiKi has noticed that the question contains two ideas: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">cultures</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ages</span>. It makes sense to look at these two ideas separately and use them as the basis for our two main paragraphs. This is a great way to approach many IELTS questions.</p>

<p>So, do you have a personal example or story about how the arts have affected your life? I'm sure you remember a special experience, such as seeing a famous painting, attending a wonderful concert, or reading a great work of fiction. Practise telling your story!</p>

	<p>
				<p>On my <a href="https://ieltssimon.substack.com">member site</a> I asked students to prepare vocabulary ideas for the following topic:</p>
<p><em><strong>What do the arts contribute to our lives?</strong></em></p>
<p>I gave two tips that can help you to think of vocabulary ideas.</p>
<p><strong>1) Start by thinking of examples to make the topic (the arts) more real.</strong></p>
<p>- Paintings e.g. in the National Gallery in London<br>- Music e.g. live concerts and performances<br>- Theatre e.g. a Shakespeare play</p>
<p><strong>2) Then think about the topic from different perspectives.</strong></p>
<p>- <strong>Personal:</strong> enjoyment, inspiration, enrich our lives, capture our imagination<br>- <strong>Cultural:</strong> heritage, national identity, connection to the past<br>- <strong>Economic:</strong> employment, boost the economy, attract visitors, tourism</p>
<p>Some of the students shared many more ideas, and they seemed to find the 'perspectives' idea useful. Try it yourself.</p>

	<p>
				<p>You'll see these three words in the band descriptors for writing task 2. If you want a high score, you need to <em><strong>extend</strong></em> and <em><strong>develop</strong></em> your ideas, and your writing should <em><strong>progress</strong></em> from one sentence to the next.</p>
<p>How do you achieve this?</p>
<p>My tip is to make sure that <em><strong>each sentence says something new</strong></em>. The new information could be a reason, an example, a consequence, an alternative, a prediction...</p>
<p>It's easy to make the mistake of repeating the same idea in slightly different ways. Don't do this. Don't feel that you need to rephrase a point that you've already made. Instead, make your point and then extend or develop it.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here's my sample essay for the question below.</p>
<p><em><strong>Genetic engineering is an important issue in society today. Some people think that it will improve people’s lives in many ways. Others feel that it may be a threat to life on earth. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.</strong></em></p>
<p>It is true that genetic engineering is a key area of modern scientific research, with broad implications for all human societies. While I accept that this field of technology may have its dangers, I believe that the benefits of genetic engineering outweigh the drawbacks.</p>
<p>The negative implications of genetic engineering are often discussed in terms of two key areas, which are food production and the cloning of humans. Genetically modified crops are already being grown, and people are concerned that they may damage whole ecosystems as foods become resistant to diseases and natural predators. But perhaps even more worrying is the possibility that humans could be modified or cloned. Some people imagine a world in which cloned humans are used to fight wars or to provide body part replacements. Although perhaps not a threat to life on earth, the implications of such practices would be unprecedented.</p>
<p>A more optimistic prediction, and one that I favour, is that humans will find ways to mitigate the risks and use genetic technologies in a responsible way. From the food production perspective, genetic engineering could be the solution to famine in developing countries, if, for instance, crops can be grown more reliably in harsh conditions. From a medical perspective, scientists may use genetic engineering to produce vaccines, to cure diseases, or to correct a genetic defect before a child is born. If properly regulated, even cloning can be done in a way that improves lives. For example, the cloning of individual organs, such as a heart or kidney, could be permitted for transplant purposes.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I am convinced that genetic engineering will have a positive impact on our lives, and that people's fears will be unwarranted.</p>

	<p>
				<p>I often receive questions like this from students:</p>
<p><em>For 'agree or disagree' questions, my teacher told me that I should mention both sides of the argument, even if I have a strong opinion. Is this true? And how do I do it?</em></p>
<p>Here's my answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is <em><strong>not</strong> <strong>true</strong></em> that you must always mention both sides.</li>
<li>The way you answer will depend on the <strong><em>particular question</em></strong> and on the <em><strong>ideas</strong></em> that you have.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's look at some examples:</p>
<p>1) Look at the strong opinion essay that I shared <a href="https://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2019/03/ielts-writing-task-2-choices-essay.html">here</a>. My argument is that we <em><strong>do</strong></em> have too many choices, and I think it would be strange to contradict myself by writing about the opposite view. Why would I want to mention the view that we <strong><em>don't</em></strong> have too many choices?</p>
<p>2) Now look at <a href="https://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2015/09/ielts-writing-task-2-strong-opinion-essay.html">this essay</a>. You'll see that I express a strong opinion in paragraph two, and then I refute (argue against) some opposite views in paragraph three. In other words, I do mention the other side of the argument, but in a negative way.</p>
<p>3) Finally, if you study <a href="https://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2011/12/ielts-writing-task-2-help-essay.html">this essay</a>, you'll see that I am able to write about both sides of the topic in a balanced way, even though I disagree with the argument given in the question.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em><br>When somebody tells you that you must always answer in a certain way, you should be cautious. If you're confused, just forget all of the advice, and focus instead on what the question is asking you to do.</p>

<li><em>Spending on salaries rose<strong>. While,</strong> spending on resources fell.<br></em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Note: the student used 'while' incorrectly between two simple sentences)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The correct version would be this:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Spending on salaries rose<strong>, while</strong> spending on resources fell.<br></em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Note: the correct version is a complex sentence)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The student made three similar mistakes with the word 'while', and I gave the answer a band 6 for grammar. If the student had written three correct 'while' sentences, I would have given a 7 for grammar.</p>
<p>I call this type of mistake a <strong><em>'sticking point'</em></strong> because it keeps you stuck on a lower band. In this case, the 'while' mistake is important because the student missed the opportunity to create three complex sentences.</p>
<p>Ask a teacher to help you to look for 'sticking points' in your writing. Getting past these sticking points could be the fastest route to a higher score.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Many people are confused by the idea that they are doing the IELTS <em><strong>academic</strong></em> writing test. They think this means that they need to use "academic" words, or that IELTS writing is similar to university academic writing.</p>
<p>All of this is wrong. Here's why:</p>
<ul>
<li>Examiners are not looking for "academic" words. There is nothing in the scoring criteria that tells examiners to do this. Instead, examiners are told to look for a <strong><em>wide range</em></strong> of vocabulary, <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2013/02/ielts-advice-phrases-and-collocations.html">collocations</a>, and some <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2016/02/ielts-vocabulary-less-common-not-advanced.html">less common vocabulary</a>.</li>
<li>IELTS writing (especially task 2) is more like a <em><strong>high school</strong></em> writing task, rather than a university assignment. In a university assignment, for example, you will never see the question "do you agree or disagree?". At university you are expected to use research as the basis of your writing, but in the IELTS test you only have your own ideas and opinions. You are even told that you can use examples from your own personal experience in IELTS writing task 2. This isn't very "academic"!</li>
</ul>
<p>So, it's best to ignore the word "academic". Ignore any advice that relates to university academic writing; IELTS writing has its own 'rules' and requirements, and I do my best to explain these here on the blog.</p>

	<p>
				<p>I sometimes receive questions from students about the '<a href="https://www.examenglish.com/vocabulary/academic_wordlist.html">academic word list</a>'. Here's what people want to know:</p>
<p><em><strong>Is this list useful for IELTS preparation?</strong></em></p>
<p>The short answer (in my opinion) is <strong>no</strong>. I've never used the academic word list with IELTS students.</p>
<p>Here's a longer answer:</p>
<p>Of course there are lots of useful words on the academic word list, and it would be great if you knew all of them. But remember: <em><strong>understanding is not the same as using</strong></em>. You would need to spend time learning how to <em><strong>use</strong></em> the words correctly in phrases and sentences. Furthermore, the list contains only individual words; you need to build your knowledge of phrases and collocations, and the list doesn't help you with that.</p>
<p>If you're preparing for IELTS, I think you have other priorities: test practice, exam techniques, question types, topic vocabulary, phrases and collocations, reducing grammar mistakes etc. Unless you have <em><strong>a lot</strong></em> of study time, I wouldn't include the academic word list in your study schedule.</p>

<li>I also think about key words or phrases from the question that I could reuse or paraphrase.</li>

<ul>
<li>I'm going to start with 'In conclusion', and I want to write one <em><strong>concise</strong></em> sentence only.</li>
<li>I need to repeat the idea that the benefits of genetic engineering outweigh the drawbacks (using different words).</li>
<li>In my introduction I used a "while" sentence (while I accept the dangers, I believe the benefits...).</li>
<li>So I'll start my conclusion with the benefits and then use the phrase "in spite of" to mention the dangers.</li>
<li>Instead of "threat to life" or "dangers", I could write about the "risks".</li>
<li>Instead of "improve people's lives", I could write that it will have a "positive impact".</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Here's a concise conclusion using the ideas above:</strong></p>
<p><em>In conclusion, I am convinced that genetic engineering will have a positive impact on our lives, in spite of its potential risks.</em></p>

	<p>
				<p>Here's my answer to the task in yesterday's lesson: the method was fine, but the language can be improved.</p>
<p><strong>The method is fine:</strong><br>The student wrote the introduction in the way that I recommend: the first sentence introduces the topic, and the second sentence answers the question.</p>
<p><strong>But there are some language problems (underlined below):</strong><br>There are different views <span style="text-decoration: underline;">regarding on question that</span> should children be punished to learn the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">discrepancy</span> between <span style="text-decoration: underline;">wrong and right</span>. From my perspective, some sorts of punishment<span style="text-decoration: underline;">s</span> as well as rewards are necessary to teach children, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">however</span>, parents and teachers should apply soft and simple forms of punishment.</p>
<p><strong>Here's my improved version:</strong><br>People have different views <span style="text-decoration: underline;">with regard to the question of whether</span> children should be punished in order to teach them the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">difference</span> between <span style="text-decoration: underline;">right and wrong</span>. In my opinion, simple or 'soft' punishments are a necessary tool for parents and teachers as they raise and educate children.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em><br>Sometimes people make 'mistakes' in their choice of vocabulary. For example, in English we say "the difference between right and wrong", not "the discrepancy between wrong and right". This is not a grammar mistake, it's a collocation mistake.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Some IELTS candidates rely far too much on linking words. If you start every sentence of your essay with a typical linking word (firstly, furthermore, moreover etc.), your writing will seem 'mechanical' and you probably won't get higher than a band 6 for coherence and cohesion (25% of your score).</p>
<p>The opposite extreme is to use none of the typical linking words. In last week's <a href="https://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2019/09/ielts-writing-task-2-advanced-linking.html">lesson</a> I showed you an example of this. I called it "the art of linking without linking". The only problem with this way of writing is that you need to be an advanced user of English to do it well. It's the kind of thing that a native speaker or band 9 candidate might do.</p>
<p>Most candidates should aim to be somewhere between these two extremes. Try to use linking words in a natural way. It makes sense to use 'Furthermore' when you're adding to an idea, and it makes sense to use 'For example' when you're giving an example.</p>
<p>In short, linking words are useful, but you shouldn't rely on them; they are not going to impress the examiner or magically give you a high score.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Most people learn linking words like <em><strong>firstly, furthermore, moreover, however, whereas</strong></em>. There's nothing wrong with this type of linking; I use it myself.</p>
<p>Another way to link ideas between or within sentences is to use pronouns and determiners like <em><strong>it, they, which, this, that</strong></em>.</p>
<p>And perhaps the most 'advanced' form of linking involves no linking words at all. Instead, you rely on the <strong><em>topic vocabulary</em></strong> itself to create cohesion.</p>
<p><strong>I call this "the art of linking without linking". Here's an example:</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">..........</span></p>

	<p>
				<p>Last <a href="https://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2019/08/ielts-advice-your-learning-environment.html">Sunday</a> I asked for your comments regarding the following question:</p>
<p><em><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; -moz-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">How can you improve your environment so that it accelerates your learning?</span></em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">People shared lots of good ideas in the comments below the lesson. Here are a few of my own tips:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">First, it's important to realise how important your environment is. If you live and work with native English speakers and you're surrounded by the English language all day, you're going to improve much more quickly than someone who studies English from a book for one hour each day. </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">Knowing that the 'native speaker' environment is the ideal, try to set up your environment so that it is a close to this ideal as possible.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">Second, I recommend finding an environment that challenges you. If you attend a course of English lessons, for example, it shouldn't be an easy course. You need to feel like you're learning something useful in every lesson, and your teacher should be highlighting your mistakes and pushing you to perform better.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">Third, I think it helps if you feel that you're part of a community of learners who have shared goals. By following this blog, you are already doing this to some extent.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">Finally, use the Internet to get as much language 'input' as you can. Even if you're studying alone, you have access to a world of English content online. You can probably also find people to talk to and practise with.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">Here's a shorter answer: Surround yourself with as much English as you can, and take every opportunity to practise what you learn.</span></p>

	<p>
				<p>Here's my band 9 sample answer for the task below. We'll analyse it next week.</p>
<p><em><strong>In many countries today, people in cities either live alone or in small family units, rather than in large, extended family groups. Is this a positive or negative trend?</strong></em></p>
<p>It is true that cities are seeing a rise in smaller families and one-person households, while the extended family is becoming a rarity. In my opinion, this is a negative development.</p>
<p>As families become smaller, the traditional family support network is disappearing, and this can have a negative impact on children as they grow up. In a nuclear family or single-parent household, childcare becomes an expensive and stressful part of daily life. Without the help of grandparents or aunts and uncles, busy parents must rely on babysitters, nannies and after-school clubs to take care of younger children, while older children may be left alone after school and during holidays. The absence of adult family members can mean that friends, television and the Internet become the primary influences on children’s behaviour. It is no surprise that the decline of the extended family has been linked to a rise in psychological and behavioural problems amongst young people.</p>
<p>The trend towards people living alone is perhaps even more damaging because of the psychological effects of reduced human interaction. Individuals who live on their own have nobody to talk to in person, so they cannot share problems or discuss the highs and lows of daily life. They forgo the constant stimulation and hustle and bustle of a large family, and are left to their own devices for extended periods of time. The lack of human contact in the home is necessarily replaced by passive distractions, such as television, video games, online chat rooms or Internet surfing. This type of existence is associated with boredom, loneliness, and feelings of isolation or even alienation, all of which are factors that are known to increase the risk of mental illness.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I believe that individuals thrive when they are part of larger family groups, and so it is worrying that many people are choosing to live alone or in such small family units.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Yesterday I gave some advice about putting yourself in an English language environment. But how do you do that? How can you improve your environment so that it accelerates your learning?</p>
<p>Several people asked these questions in the comments below yesterday's lesson, so let's have a discussion: what do you think?</p>

	<p>
				<p>What's the fastest way to improve your English?</p>
<p>Well, in my opinion the answer is this: <em><strong>put yourself in the best possible English language environment.</strong></em></p>
<p>Studying alone is a slow, hard journey. But if you can find a way to surround yourself with English speakers, or a community of English learners, you'll make faster progress and the journey won't seem so arduous.</p>
<p>If you're feeling stuck or isolated as you learn English and prepare for the IELTS test, perhaps you need to find an environment or community that can carry you forward.</p>

<p><strong>Topic:</strong> The effects of smaller families on children.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Many students ask how long it will take to get from an intermediate level (maybe IELTS band 5) to an advanced level (band 7).</p>
<p>If you were learning to play the piano, would you expect to go from intermediate to advanced in a few weeks? Would you expect to find a special technique that suddenly makes you an advanced pianist? The answer is no. Most people know that they would need to work hard and practise every day to get to an advanced level on the piano.</p>
<p>In my opinion, learning a new language is a similar challenge. You should aim to make small, gradual improvements because it isn't realistic to expect sudden changes.</p>

	<p>
				<p style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">Whenever I do a course on IELTS writing here in Manchester, I always ask the students this question at the end of the day:</p>
<p style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><em>What did I teach you today that will&nbsp;<strong>change</strong>&nbsp;the way you do the test?</em></p>
<p style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">One of the most common answers that students give me is:&nbsp;<em>doing a good essay plan and&nbsp;<strong>numbering</strong>&nbsp;the ideas in the plan.</em>&nbsp;(as shown in <a href="http://subscriptions.viddler.com/SimonCorcoran/fkvcqe" target="_self" title="">this video lesson</a>).</p>
<p style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">If you put the numbers 1 to 5 next to the ideas that you have for each main paragraph, your only task when writing the essay is to turn those 5 ideas into 5 full sentences. Practise doing this, and you'll find that paragraph writing becomes much easier.</p>

	<h4><a href="https://www.ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2019/08/ielts-advice-plethora.html">IELTS Advice: 'plethora'</a></h4>
	<p>
				<p>Yesterday I told you that my examiner friend and I advise students not to use the word 'plethora' in their essays. Why not? Well, for a plethora ;) of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plethora means 'many'. If you write that there are a plethora of reasons and then give only one or two reasons, you've used the word wrongly.</li>
<li>The word plethora seems too exaggerated, pompous or pretentious for an IELTS essay. It doesn't suit the 'measured' academic style that we're aiming for.</li>
<li>If the rest of your essay is written in a more basic style, a word like plethora will stand out as strange and unnatural.</li>
<li>If you attempt to use 'impressive' words but your essay is full of mistakes, it is obvious to the examiner that you're trying to show off. When surrounded by grammar mistakes, a word like plethora looks even more unnatural.</li>
<li>I'm a native speaker, and I would only use the word plethora if I really wanted to exaggerate something, or to sound pretentious on purpose (perhaps for humorous effect). I wouldn't use it in an academic essay.</li>
<li>Finally, plethora is an example of what I call an <em><strong>'any essay</strong> <strong>word'</strong></em>. Students learn words like this because they hope to use them in any essay, regardless of the topic. In other words, these students are trying to 'trick' the examiner into being impressed - this doesn't work. If you want to impress the examiner, you should focus on specific <a href="https://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2019/05/ielts-vocabulary-topic-specific-vocabulary.html">topic vocabulary</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope this convinces you to stop learning words like plethora. Just write "there are several reasons" or "there are two main reasons" and then focus on describing them. Leave the pompous language to politicians!</p>

				<p>Many students write to me because they are worried about strange or difficult questions they have found (usually for writing task 2).</p>
<p>I think you need to remember that it's impossible to prepare for every topic or question that might appear in the exam. You will go mad if you try to do this!</p>
<p>The solution is to make sure you "know what you know". Focus on the <a href="https://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2016/05/ielts-vocabulary-topic-list.html">common topics</a> that appear regularly, not the strange topic that your friend found on a website.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Too many students (and teachers) waste time worrying about the 'complex structures' aspect of the grammar score in the writing test.</p>
<p>From what I've seen when marking essays, 99% of students are able to write sentences with more than one clause, using words like <strong><em>and, but, because, while, which, if...</em></strong> to connect ideas. Therefore, they are able to meet the requirement for 'complex structures'.</p>
<p>On the other hand, many of the same students are <strong><em>not</em></strong> able to produce <em><strong>frequent error-free sentences</strong></em> (band 7), and it's rare for me to see essays in which <strong><em>the majority of sentences are error-free</em></strong> (band 8).</p>
<p>So, if people can't produce error-free sentences, why are they worrying about complex structures? In most cases, the key to a high grammar score is <strong><em>fewer mistakes</em></strong>, not more complex sentences.</p>

<p>..........</p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>It is true that cities are seeing a rise in smaller families and one-person households, while the extended family is becoming a rarity. In my opinion, this is a negative development.</p>
<p><strong>Paragraph 2, topic sentence</strong><br>As families become smaller, the traditional family support network is disappearing, and this can have a negative impact on children as they grow up.</p>
<p><strong>Paragraph 3, topic sentence</strong><br>The trend towards people living alone is perhaps even more damaging because of the psychological effects of reduced human interaction.</p>

<p>So how do you connect your ideas (cohesion) without attracting too much attention? I think there are 2 possible ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Explain your ideas in a logical order so that you don't need many linking words. This is probably what you do when writing in your own language.</li>

	<p>
				<p>I keep seeing comments and questions from students that include the following sentences:</p>
<p>- I <span style="text-decoration: underline;">gave</span> the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">test</span> on Saturday.<br>- I <span style="text-decoration: underline;">gave</span> my IELTS <span style="text-decoration: underline;">exam</span> last week.</p>
<p><em><strong>Both of the sentences above are wrong!</strong></em> You don't "give" a test or exam. This is the wrong <strong>verb + noun</strong> collocation.</p>
<p>Here are some <em><strong>correct collocations</strong></em> with the words test or exam:</p>
<p>- I <span style="text-decoration: underline;">took</span> the test / exam.<br>- I <span style="text-decoration: underline;">sat</span> the test / exam.<br>- I <span style="text-decoration: underline;">did</span> the test / exam.<br>- I <span style="text-decoration: underline;">passed</span> the test / exam.</p>
<p>It's important to use the right collocations. Getting them wrong makes your English sound strange. "I gave the test" sounds completely wrong.</p>

	<p>
				<p>The first sentence of a main body paragraph is often called the 'topic sentence'.</p>
<p>There's a simple reason why topic sentences are important in IELTS essays: Examiners want to see a <em>"clear central topic within each paragraph"</em> (band 7 descriptor for coherence and cohesion). So if you start your main paragraphs with a topic sentence, you can make sure that the "central topic" of each one is clear.</p>
<p><strong>Task:</strong><br>Have another look at the essay plan that I wrote for last week's <a href="https://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2019/06/ielts-writing-task-2-small-families-essay-plan.html">lesson</a>. Can you write a topic sentence for each of the two main paragraphs?</p>

<p>When telling stories, native speakers use lots of 'natural' linking words and phrases. Have a look at the following examples from my description:</p>
<ul>
<li>This happened (referring to previous sentence)</li>
<li>and at some point</li>
<li>so</li>
<li>It (referring to the restaurant previously mentioned)</li>
<li>But as soon as</li>

<li>By this time</li>
<li>yet (meaning 'but in spite of that')</li>
<li>We decided</li>
<li>and fortunately</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that <em><strong>I didn't use any of the typical linking words that people learn</strong></em> (Moreover, Furthermore etc.). Those lists of typical linking phrases won't help you to get a higher score. Try to practise 'natural' linking instead!</p>

	<p>
				<p>Look at the two short paragraphs below. Can you see the difference between them?</p>
<p><strong>Paragraph 1</strong><br>Every member of society should contribute to improving the environment. We all need to take responsibility for the environmental issues that face the planet. If each individual person plays his or her part, our world will remain habitable for future generations.</p>
<p><strong>Paragraph 2</strong><br>Every member of society should contribute to improving the environment. Small daily actions, like turning lights off or recycling paper, glass and plastics, can make a difference. I also try to play my part by walking or by taking public transport rather than driving.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis</strong></p>
<p>Paragraph 1 might look good in terms of the vocabulary that I used, but it doesn't really move forward. The three sentences basically say the same thing in different ways. It's all too general.</p>
<p>Paragraph 2 might seem simpler, but it's much better in terms of 'task response' and 'coherence' because the main idea is extended and we can see some progression. Can you see the <em><strong>movement from general to specific</strong></em> in this paragraph?</p>

				<p>I've been checking students' essays this week, and one of the most noticeable problems has been this: <em><strong>most essays are too general</strong></em>, and so there's not enough development and progression of ideas.</p>
<p>When writing a paragraph, or when giving a longer answer in part 3 of the speaking test, try to use a <em><strong>general to specific</strong></em> approach. Start with a general idea, then explain it in more detail.</p>
<p>Note: Don't just explain the same general idea in a different way. Your answer needs to <em><strong>move forward</strong></em>.</p>

	<p>
				<p>One of the main aims of this blog is to give people a method for tackling each aspect of the IELTS test.</p>
<p>I hear from many people who have been successful after following my advice, but I also hear from people who haven't passed yet. And when people are stuck on the same score, they sometimes think that "the method isn't working". But this is the wrong way to think.</p>
<p>Methods / exam techniques will only help you to get the score that reflects your current level of English. If your English level is 'beginner' or 'intermediate', no method will suddenly give you a band 7. Exam techniques don't increase your vocabulary knowledge or your grammatical accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>Remember that we're working on 2 things here:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Methods e.g. knowing how to write an essay.</li>
<li>English language e.g. expressing your ideas using good vocabulary and without making mistakes.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you've been following my advice but you're stuck on the same score, don't change your method! Instead, work on point 2 above.</p>

<p>When the question asks "To what extent do you agree or disagree?", you should state your view in the introduction, support it in the main body paragraphs, and repeat or summarise it in the conclusion. The whole essay needs to be about YOUR views, not the views of other people.</p>

				<p>Yesterday I said that linking words don't help your vocabulary score, and that you need to use 'topic specific' vocabulary if you want a high score.</p>

<p>The answer is: vocabulary that you would <em><strong>probably only use for one particular essay topic</strong></em>. For example, I used this vocabulary in a lesson last week:</p>

<p>If you've followed my lessons on this blog, you'll know that "any essay" phrases are not the secret to getting a high score in IELTS writing.

<p>However, linkers become a problem when they are the only thing that students care about. Examiners care much more about the <em><strong>content between</strong></em> the linkers.</p>

<li>Band 7: frequent error-free sentences</li>
<li>Band 8: the majority of sentences are error-free</li>
</ul>
<p>So, there's no point trying to impress the examiner with difficult structures if none of your sentences are error-free. It's better to keep things simple and avoid mistakes.</p>

	<p>
				<p>As I've said before, there is no 'secret' way to improve your IELTS score. You just need to study hard and keep practising. However, if I had to give one piece of advice, it would be this: work on <em><strong>vocabulary</strong></em>.</p>
<p>If you use a wide range of vocabulary in the speaking and writing exams, you are more likely to get a high score. Vocabulary is also the key to finding the answers in the reading test and understanding the speakers in the listening test.</p>
<p>So, are you writing new words and phrases in a notebook every day? Do you read something in English every day? Do you use a dictionary? Do you use Google or Wikipedia to look up words and phrases? If you don't do these things, start now!</p>

	<p>
				<p>Regarding the advice that I gave yesterday (stop and smile), I just want to clarify that there are no marks for body language in the speaking test. The "stop and smile" idea is simply a way to show the examiner that you're ready for the next question in part 1 of the test.</p>
<p>So, smiling won't help your score, but it can help with the "flow" of questions and answers in part 1.</p>

	<p>
				<p>What are the best things to do in the last week before your exam? Here are some tips:</p>
<p><strong>1. Nothing new</strong><br>It's often best not to study anything new just before an exam. "Revision" means studying what you have already studied to make sure that you know it well. The aim is to be confident about what you <em><strong>do</strong></em> know, rather than worrying about what you <em><strong>don't</strong></em> know.</p>
<p><strong>2. Common topics</strong><br>It's always a good idea to look again at the most common topics for IELTS writing and speaking. Make sure you have some ideas, opinions and vocabulary for topics like 'education', 'environment' etc.</p>
<p><strong>3. Test practice</strong><br>If you have never done a full test (e.g. a full one-hour reading test) before, you might get a shock in the real exam! Timing is a big problem, so practise a full test in strict exam conditions. Don't worry about your score; just focus on finishing everything within the time limit.</p>

	<p>
				<p>I almost always write 4 paragraphs, but sometimes the question requires a different approach. For example, a student asked me to return to the question below (from Cambridge IELTS 4). I wrote a couple of lessons about this topic back in 2012, but we didn't finish the full essay.</p>
<p><em><strong>Compare the advantages and disadvantages of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">three</span> of the following as media for communicating information. State which you consider to be the most effective.</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>comics</strong></em></li>
<li><em><strong>books</strong></em></li>
<li><em><strong>radio</strong></em></li>
<li><em><strong>television</strong></em></li>
<li><em><strong>film</strong></em></li>
<li><em><strong>theatre</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p>Here are my <span style="text-decoration: underline;">three</span> main body paragraphs.<br><strong>Can you add the introduction and conclusion?</strong></p>
<p>The main advantage of books is that they are usually considered to be reliable sources of information. People tend to refer to books when they want to research a subject in depth, and for this reason they continue to play an important role in education. On the other hand, books quickly go out of date, and therefore they are not the best medium for communicating news stories.</p>
<p>Radio is a much more effective medium than books for the communication of up-to-date information. We can listen to news broadcasts about events as they happen, and a key benefit of radio is that we can listen to it while doing other activities, such as driving or working. The main drawback of radio, when compared to books or television, is that there is no visual element; we cannot see what the broadcaster is describing.</p>
<p>In my opinion, television is the most effective of these three media because it brings us closer to reality than a book or radio programme ever can. For example, we can watch events as they take place on the other side of the world, or we can see the body language of a politician who is being interviewed. The disadvantages of television are that programmes tend to be short and interrupted by advertisements, meaning that information is presented in limited depth.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Many people work hard but with the wrong aims. Their hard work takes them in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>Here are two examples of the <strong>wrong aims</strong> (for IELTS students):</p>
<ol>
<li>Learning "impressive" phrases for linking and organising your ideas.</li>
<li>Becoming better at English grammar by working through exercises in a grammar book.</li>
</ol>
<p>You could do many hours of hard work on these two aims, but I doubt that your IELTS scores would improve.</p>
<p>Your next question should be: What are the <strong>right aims</strong>? If you've read enough of my lessons, you'll know what I think. Maybe you would like to share your aims in the comments below this lesson, and we can discuss and refine them.</p>

	<p>
				<p>A student asked me this useful question:</p>
<p><em>In writing task 2, isn't it better to write about just one idea in each main body paragraph? If we put two or three ideas in the same paragraph (e.g. firstly, secondly, finally), we can't explain each idea in as much detail.</em></p>
<p>Here's my answer to this question:</p>
<p>Some questions require you to put more than one idea in each main paragraph. For example, if the question asks you to explain the advantage<span style="text-decoration: underline;">s</span>, disadvantage<span style="text-decoration: underline;">s</span>, reason<span style="text-decoration: underline;">s</span>, cause<span style="text-decoration: underline;">s</span> or solution<span style="text-decoration: underline;">s</span>, you must give more than one. Therefore a "firstly, secondly, finally" paragraph structure is perfect. If the question doesn't contain a plural word, one idea per paragraph is fine.</p>
<p>To learn the two methods that I use for writing paragraphs, study <a href="https://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2018/01/ielts-writing-task-2-main-paragraph-methods.html">this lesson</a>.</p>

	<p>
				<p>People who become good at things do the basics well, and they only show off occasionally.</p>
<p>For example, native speakers (of any language) spend most of their time using clear and relatively simple language. They might add a 'flourish' here and there, but it's rare to meet a native speaker who tries to make every sentence seem impressive.</p>
<p>I try to persuade students to aim for this 'natural' native-speaker style of writing and speaking. Learn to write and speak in a clear, simple, accurate and coherent way. Leave the rhetorical flourishes to politicians and professional writers!</p>

	<p>
				<p>Depending on what scores my students are aiming for, I give different advice.</p>
<p><strong>If you are aiming for band 5, 5.5 or 6:</strong></p>
<p>You can reach band 6 with fairly 'easy' language if your essay structure is good, your ideas are relevant to the question topic, and you write at least 250 words. Look through the writing task 2 lessons on this website to learn how to write introductions, main paragraphs and conclusions, and work on writing short, simple sentences to express your ideas.</p>
<p>When people get band 5 or below, it is often because they don't finish their essays, they go off-topic, they have no idea about good essay structure, or they try to use 'difficult' language and therefore make lots of mistakes. For bands 5 to 6, keep your essays simple and clear.</p>
<p><strong>If you are aiming for band 7 or higher:</strong></p>
<p>First, you need to do everything that I mentioned above: you need relevant ideas, a good essay structure, and you must write at least 250 words.</p>
<p>But to reach the higher scores, your essays need more 'depth'. You need to explain your ideas in more detail, using a wider range of vocabulary. At this level, <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2015/07/ielts-writing-task-2-structure-is-not-the-secret.html" target="_self" title="">good essay structure is not enough</a>, and memorised linking phrases won't help either.

	<p>
				<p>Every IELTS teacher will suggest a slightly different way of doing each part of the test. In other words, teachers have different methods.</p>
<p>An example of a method is my <a href="https://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2015/02/ielts-writing-task-2-13-sentences.html">13-sentences</a> approach to writing a task 2 essay. This is how I like to break down the writing task, but it isn't the only way. Other teachers' methods can be equally good.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are principles that all IELTS teachers should agree on. For example, when you write an essay, you need to present a clear position and answer all parts of the question.</p>
<p>Many IELTS students are confused by all of the different 'methods' that teachers give them. Perhaps we need to focus more on 'principles'.</p>

	<p>
				<p>One of the key principles that you should remember when writing a task 2 essay is this: make sure that <em><strong>your <span style="text-decoration: underline;">position</span> is clear <span style="text-decoration: underline;">throughout</span> the essay</strong></em>.</p>
<p>Your "position" is your overall answer to the question. It is an expression of <em><strong>where you stand</strong></em> on the issue or topic.</p>
<p>Notice also my use of the word "throughout". Your position should be made clear in the introduction, supported in the main paragraphs, and restated in the conclusion.</p>

	<p>
				<p>I've written about the difference between <em><strong>understanding</strong></em> and <em><strong>using</strong></em> before, but I think it's worth repeating this idea.</p>
<p>Have another look at the list of phrases in yesterday's lesson. Perhaps you <em><strong>understand</strong></em> all of the individual words in that list. But ask yourself this: would you have been able to <em><strong>use</strong></em> those words to create correct phrases, and a coherent essay, in the same way that I did?</p>
<p>Using words and phrases is much more difficult than simply understanding what they mean. While <em><strong>understanding</strong></em> only requires a quick dictionary search, <em><strong>using</strong></em> requires considerable language experience and practice.</p>

	<p>
				<p>You can learn a lot by analysing a well-written essay. Here's a quick analysis of the <a href="https://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2019/03/ielts-writing-task-2-choices-essay.html">essay</a> that I shared last Wednesday:</p>
<p><strong>Method</strong><br>As usual, I wrote 4 paragraphs containing 13 sentences in total. If you always follow the same writing method, you'll feel confident that you know exactly how to write your essay in the exam. If you have time, look at my 13 sentences again and analyse what each one is doing.</p>
<p><strong>Style</strong><br>I consider task 2 essays (like the one I wrote) to be <em><strong>"high school style"</strong></em> essays, rather than "university level" essays. This is because we're writing about our own ideas and opinions; we don't have access to any research. Task 2 essays should be clear and easy to read, with a focus on relevant ideas and good 'topic vocabulary'. You won't have time to develop the kind of detailed arguments that a university teacher would expect, so imagine that you're writing for your high school teacher!</p>
<p><strong>Focus</strong><br>IELTS students often worry too much about grammar; they think that they need to fill their essays with passives, conditionals, compound sentences, complex sentences etc. I tell my students not to think about those things. Instead, we focus on <strong><em>vocabulary</em></strong>: expressing our ideas well and making sure that we answer the question. Vocabulary (ideas) was my main focus when I wrote the essay.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here's my band 9 sample answer for the question below. I followed the essay plan that you can see in <a href="https://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2019/02/ielts-writing-task-2-choices-plan.html">this lesson</a>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Some people believe that nowadays we have too many choices. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?</strong></em></p>
<p>It is often said that modern life presents us with an overwhelming number of choices. I completely agree with this, and I believe that the Internet and globalisation are the two major factors involved.</p>
<p>It is undeniable that the Internet has led to a dramatic expansion in the number of choices that are available to us. The number of online media options, for instance, is now almost endless. There are countless websites offering entertainment, news, videos, on-demand TV and music streaming, many of which are free. I would argue that this abundance of media leads to confusion on the part of the average user, as we have to make so many decisions about the content that we consume. A personal example of this trend would be the fact that I had a choice of just four TV channels when I was a child, whereas I now have access to thousands of films and series through services like Netflix.</p>
<p>Alongside the influence of the Internet, globalisation is making the world smaller and compounding this problem of too much choice. Cheap international flights have made overseas travel possible for millions of people, but this also means that we are faced with a world of options when deciding where to go on holiday or even where to live. We no longer have the limited but simple travel choices of our grandparents’ generation. The same is true if we look at the increasing tendency for young people to study abroad. While the opportunity for overseas study seems appealing, many students are confused about where to go and which path to take.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we are faced with a huge number of options in most areas of life nowadays, and this is often more bewildering than beneficial.</p>

	<p>
				<p>A few people have asked me about these phrases. Do they have the same meaning? When is each one used?</p>
<p><strong>By contrast / In contrast</strong><br>I often use these two phrases in both writing task 1 and 2. They are exactly the same, and are used in a similar way to "however" or "on the other hand" to introduce a contrast / comparison. Put "By / In contrast" at the beginning of a sentence, with a comma after "contrast".</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong><br>Unemployment rose in the UK. By contrast, the number of unemployed people in Canada fell.</p>
<p><strong>On the contrary</strong><br>I don't think you'll need this phrase for any part of the IELTS test.&nbsp;It doesn't mean the same thing as "by / in contrast". We use "on the contrary" to deny that something is true, and to explain that the opposite is true.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong><br>- Person 1: "You had some problems with your hotel, didn't you?"<br>- Person 2: "On the contrary, the hotel was great, but the airline lost my suitcase."</p>

	<p>
				<p>If the question asks whether <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you</span> agree or disagree, it is asking for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">your</span> opinion. You should express your opinion in the introduction, and support it in the rest of the essay.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Don’t</span> structure an “opinion” essay like this:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Introduction</li>
<li>Paragraph supporting the opposite opinion</li>
<li>Paragraph supporting my opinion</li>
<li>Conclusion</li>
</ol>
<p>The problem with this essay structure is that paragraph 2 is not consistent with my opinion. This is a “discussion” essay structure!</p>
<p>Think of it this way: your task when you answer an “agree or disagree” question is to persuade the reader that your view is right. Each paragraph should defend <span style="text-decoration: underline;">your</span> opinion.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em><br>You can write about both sides of the argument if you say that you "partly agree".

	<p>
				<p>The list of <em><strong>less common vocabulary</strong></em> in yesterday's lesson didn't contain any words that are 'big' or impressive on their own.</p>
<p>In fact, if you're trying to impress the examiner with good vocabulary, you shouldn't be worrying about <em><strong>individual</strong></em> words at all. Instead, you should be trying to show that you can use <em><strong>interesting groups of words</strong></em>.</p>
<p>Here's an easy example. The three words below are not particularly special or impressive on their own:</p>
<p>- incredible<br>- beautiful<br>- images</p>
<p>But look at how I put these words together in the sentence below:</p>
<p><em><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; -moz-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">The TV trailers were really eye-catching because they showed <strong>incredibly beautiful images</strong> of nature.</span></em></p>
<p>The phrase "incredibly beautiful images" is much more interesting (and 'less common') than the three individual words that it contains.</p>
<p><strong>Remember:</strong> It's only when you start putting words together that the language comes alive. Focus on groups of words, not individual 'big' words.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Did you note down the following 'less common' phrases from the description that I wrote yesterday? Could you use these phrases in your own sentences?</p>
<ul>
<li>each episode featured</li>
<li>spectacular footage</li>
<li>it was broadcast</li>
<li>the DVD box set</li>
<li>it was advertised repeatedly</li>
<li>it was aired (means 'it was shown on TV')</li>
<li>the trailers were eye-catching</li>
<li>incredibly beautiful images</li>
<li>the voice of the narrator</li>
<li>stunning photography</li>
<li>global scope</li>
<li>to film such interesting creatures in so many locations</li>
<li>opened my eyes to the hidden wonders of our planet</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em><br>The phrase 'less common vocabulary' (or 'uncommon lexical items') is used in the examiner's mark scheme. It refers to any vocabulary that examiners don't expect most candidates to use. But this <em><strong>doesn't</strong></em> mean 'difficult' words; it means the kind of 'natural' phrases that native speakers use. A good example is "DVD box set" - this isn't a difficult phrase, but it's something that English <span style="text-decoration: underline;">learners</span> might not be expected to use.</p>

	<p>
				<p>IELTS isn't simply a test of how much 'difficult' vocabulary and grammar you can use. It also tests your ability to do 'easy' things with the language, like making a simple sentence that contains no mistakes.</p>
<p>Speaking part 1 is a good example of this. In this part of the speaking test, you will impress the examiner by answering without hesitation, by speaking in a natural and fluid way, and by using error-free simple sentences. You can show off your best language later in the test, but you should start, in part 1, by showing the examiner that you can do the 'easy' things well.</p>
<p>Note: many people don't do the easy things well.</p>

	<p>
				<p>A colleague asked me for some advice about how to help a student who is so worried about the IELTS writing test that she feels unable to write an essay. She says she has a mental block and just can't start writing.</p>
<p>In my opinion, this student's problem is that she is aiming too high too soon. She wants to write the perfect essay now, but she is afraid that she won't. She's putting too much pressure on herself to be successful.</p>
<p>So here's some advice for people who feel stuck or afraid: aim much lower! Imagine you're a lazy student who just wants to do his/her homework as quickly as possible, and write an essay that you know isn't your best work - write it quickly and carelessly. Write another 'bad' essay the next day and the day after that. Soon the fear of essay writing will have disappeared, and you'll start wanting to improve your 'bad' essays. When the fear of failure has gone, you'll be free to enjoy the challenge and to do your best work.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> if you are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> suffering from this essay writing 'fear', please ignore the advice above. Aim high, enjoy the challenge, and do your best work now!</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here are some techniques that should help you to paraphrase (to say the same thing in different ways):</p>
<p><strong>1) Use a synonym</strong></p>
<p>This is important = This is significant / crucial / vital</p>
<p><strong>2) Use an opposite</strong></p>
<p>I found it difficult = It wasn't easy for me</p>
<p><strong>3) Change active to passive</strong></p>
<p>You should not do this = This should not be done</p>
<p><strong>4) Use a related word (e.g. change the verb into a noun)</strong></p>
<p>The number rose = There was a rise in the number</p>
<p><strong>5) Consider a more formal or informal version</strong></p>
<p>I am worried = I am extremely concerned (formal) / I'm stressed out (informal)</p>

	<p>
				<p>I've almost finished the essay below, but can you write a one-sentence conclusion for me?</p>
<p><em><strong>Popular hobbies and interests change over time and are more a reflection of trends and fashions than an indication of what individuals really want to do in their spare time. To what extent do you agree or disagree?</strong></em></p>
<p>Some leisure activities become fashionable for a short time and then disappear when a new trend comes along, whereas others seem to be perennially popular. I can therefore only partly agree with the assertion that hobbies reflect changing fashions rather than our true interests.</p>
<p>On the one hand, it is true that many hobbies are simply passing trends. Children and teenagers, in particular, are attracted to whatever activity is currently popular among their peers. My 10-year-old niece, for example, seems to have a new interest every month, as she joins in with the latest craze that sweeps through her primary school. Over the last year or so, she has been obsessed with Rubik’s cubes, fidget spinners, squidgies and slime. In a similar way, there have been several different fitness trends for adults over recent years, from jogging to yoga to circuit training, and I doubt whether the majority of participants continued to enjoy those activities in the long term.</p>
<p>On the other hand, many people spend their free time doing popular activities that are far from trendy. One good example would be the game chess. Children and adults who enjoy playing chess are certainly not following a new fashion or wasting their time on something that they do not truly like. On the contrary, they are passionate about a game that has existed for hundreds of years, and they find it inherently fascinating and absorbing. I would say the same about many other hobbies, from reading to swimming.</p>
<p>In conclusion,.....</p>

<p><em><strong>If you can already write at the same level as me, you don't need my help!</strong></em></p>
<p>The best way to learn is to have a teacher who takes you just outside your comfort zone. If the work is too easy you won't progress, and if it's far too difficult you won't be able to do it. A good teacher should give you work that is difficult, but achievable with help. Hopefully the paragraph that I wrote on Wednesday fits that description.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here's a paragraph supporting the opinion that <strong><em>most hobbies are just trends</em></strong> (the full question is <a href="https://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2019/01/ielts-writing-task-2-partly-agree.html">here</a>).</p>
<p><em>On the one hand, it is true that many hobbies are simply passing trends. Children and teenagers, in particular, are attracted to whatever activity is currently popular among their peers. My 10-year-old niece, for example, seems to have a new interest every month, as she joins in with the latest craze that sweeps through her primary school.

In a similar way, there have been several different fitness trends for adults over recent years, from jogging to yoga to circuit training, and I doubt whether the majority of participants continued to enjoy those activities in the long term.</em></p>
<p>Let's analyse the paragraph:</p>
<ul>
<li>My position is clear, especially from these phrases: it is true that..., I doubt whether...</li>
<li>Five sentences: 1) topic, 2) illustration using children and teenagers, 3) personal example, 4) personal example continued, 5) comparison with adults, examples and concluding view.</li>
<li>Examples of passing trends are the key feature in the paragraph: Rubik’s cubes, fidget spinners, squidgies, slime, jogging, yoga, circuit training (7 examples in total). These examples really help to support the view given in the paragraph.</li>
<li>Plenty of natural, appropriate 'topic' vocabulary: passing trends, attracted to, currently popular, among their peers, joins in with the latest craze, sweeps through her primary school, obsessed with, fitness trends, the majority of participants.</li>
<li>Good coherence. For example, notice the use of the phrase 'In a similar way', which allows me to move from talking about children to talking about adults. Notice also the relationship between sentences 2, 3 and 4: children... my niece... she.</li>
<li>Notice how I finish with a reference to the original question: "I doubt whether... in the long term" refers to the idea that "individuals don't really want to do these activities in their spare time".</li>
<li>Grammar: there's a nice mix of long and short sentences, and I can't see any mistakes!</li>

	<p>
				<p>Here's my quick brainstorm on the theme of the word 'easy'. I've divided it into a few different categories; you might find it helpful to do this yourself when brainstorming ideas.</p>
<p>Synonyms of 'easy'</p>
<ul>
<li>simple, straightforward, uncomplicated, effortless</li>

<p>Informal phrases</p>
<ul>
<li>a piece of cake, a walk in the park, a breeze, a doddle</li>

<li>it wasn't difficult, it wasn't hard, it didn't take much effort, it wasn't very challenging, it didn't present any real problems, I didn't really struggle</li>
</ul>
<p>Use an example to create context e.g. 'the exam was easy'</p>
<ul>
<li>it was fairly simple, I found it quite straightforward, I breezed through it, I could have done it in my sleep, it was easier than I expected</li>

<p><strong><em>Popular hobbies and interests change over time and are more a reflection of trends and fashions than an indication of what individuals really want to do in their spare time. To what extent do you agree or disagree?</em></strong></p>
<p>After thinking about some examples of hobbies, it seems to me that some of them are trends (e.g. video games or gym activities), whereas others have stood the test of time (e.g. jogging, football, swimming, reading).</p>
<p>I'll therefore write a 'partly agree' answer. Here's a possible introduction:</p>
<p><em>Some leisure activities become fashionable for a short time and then disappear when a new trend comes along, whereas others seem to be perennially popular. I can therefore only partly agree with the assertion that hobbies reflect changing fashions rather than our true interests.</em></p>

	<p>
				<p>Yesterday I suggested that you'll need to work on both exam technique and English language as you prepare for the IELTS test. So how can IELTS-Simon help you with these two things?</p>
<p><strong>Exam technique</strong><br>The fastest way to learn how to approach the IELTS test is to watch the video lessons that I published on <a href="http://subscriptions.viddler.com/SimonCorcoran">this website</a>. The videos take you step by step through each part of the test, and you'll see me giving band 9 answers using clear and simple exam techniques. I consider the video lessons to be my best work, and I don't know of any other course that provides such a methodical and effective approach.</p>
<p>Of course, this blog contains the same advice that you'll find in the video lessons. The difference is that the blog isn't written as a step-by-step course. If you have the time, go back through the blog's <a href="https://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/archives.html">archives</a> or <a href="https://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2016/07/ielts-advice-search-this-website.html">search</a> the blog for anything that you need. I think I've probably written a lesson about almost any IELTS problem that you might have.</p>
<p><strong>English language</strong><br>The ultimate aim of this blog is to help you to improve your English. You'll find many lessons in which language, rather than exam technique, is the main focus.</p>
<p>I'm also trying to cover as many IELTS topics as possible here on the blog, and you'll find plenty of vocabulary ideas (words, phrases, examples, opinions etc.) that you can 'copy' from me and use in your own answers.</p>

				<p>Let's think about what you're going to do in 2019. Broadly speaking, you'll probably need to work on two main things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Exam technique</li>
<li>English language</li>
</ol>
<p>Both of these areas are important, but if we're talking about a whole year of study, I think it's far more important to <em><strong>improve your English</strong></em>.</p>
<p>Imagine yourself at the end of 2019. Surely your priority should be to have a better overall level of English, not just to collect more exam tips and techniques.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong><br>Describe an interesting house or apartment.</p>

We have our own apartment which is really awesome. By the way, I would like to talk about a new apartment/flat that I have recently visited.</span></p>
<p>The real answer begins in the third sentence with the words <em><strong>"I would like to talk about"</strong></em>. This is where I would begin. Everything before that is just background waffle*. Examiners don't like this waffle; you'll impress them more if you get straight to the point and answer directly.</p>
<p>waffle = lengthy but vague or trivial talk or writing (i.e. useless extra words that you don't need)</p>

<p>Make sure that your teacher is helping you to improve your English, rather than just giving you exam tips and techniques. If you don't seem to be improving your overall knowledge of the English language, you might need to consider changing your teacher.</p>
<p>Remember: exam tips and techniques are useful and important, but <em><strong>the surest way to improve your IELTS score is by improving your English</strong></em>.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here's my full essay for the question below.</p>
<p><em><strong>Some people believe that developments in the field of artificial intelligence will have a positive impact on our lives in the near future. Others, by contrast, are worried that we are not prepared for a world in which computers are more intelligent than humans. Discuss both of these views and give your own opinion.</strong></em></p>
<p>People seem to be either excited or worried about the future impact of artificial intelligence. Personally I can understand the two opposing points of view; I am both fascinated by developments in artificial intelligence and apprehensive about its possible negative effects.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the increasing intelligence of technology should bring some obvious benefits. Machines are clearly able to do many jobs better than humans can, especially in areas that require high levels of accuracy or calculations using large amounts of data. For example, robots are being developed that can carry out surgical procedures with greater precision than a human doctor, and we already have cars that use sensors and cameras to drive themselves. Such technologies can improve safety by reducing the likelihood of human errors. It is easy to imagine how these developments, and many others, will steadily improve our quality of life.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I share the concerns of people who believe that artificial intelligence may harm us if we are not careful. In the short term, it is likely that we will see a rise in unemployment as workers in various industries are replaced by machines or software programs. For example, self-driving vehicles are expected to cause redundancies in driving jobs, such as lorry drivers, taxi drivers and bus drivers. In the medium term, if intelligent technologies gradually take jobs away from humans, we may find that people become deskilled and lose their sense of purpose in life. A longer term fear is that computers become so intelligent that they begin to make decisions without human oversight and without regard for our well-being.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while intelligent machines will no doubt improve our lives in many ways, the potential risks of such technologies should not be ignored.</p>

	<p>
				<p>A student asked me about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_they">this page</a> on Wikipedia, which gives three examples of the words "they" and "their" being used to refer to singular nouns:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Somebody</span> left <em><strong>their</strong></em> umbrella here. Would <em><strong>they</strong></em> please collect it?</li>
<li>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">patient</span> should be told how much <em><strong>they</strong></em> will be required to pay.</li>
<li>A <span style="text-decoration: underline;">journalist</span> should not be forced to reveal <em><strong>their</strong></em> sources.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>They</strong></em> and <em><strong>their</strong></em> are used instead of <strong><em>he or she</em></strong> and <em><strong>his or her</strong></em>.</p>
<p>This is very common in English, and it is unlikely that someone would say: "Somebody left <em><strong>his or her</strong></em> umbrella. Would <em><strong>he or she</strong></em> please collect it?"</p>
<p>But can we use "they" with a singular in the IELTS test?</p>
<p>The simple answer is yes, but my own preference is a little more complicated. When speaking, I naturally use "they" with singular nouns from time to time. But I tend to avoid doing this in written essays, as I prefer to stick to the normal grammatical conventions. For example, I used "he or she" in the sentence below, which comes from <a href="Firstly, it is hard for a person to be happy if he or she does not have a safe place to live and enough food to eat.">this essay</a>.</p>
<p><em><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; -moz-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">Firstly, it is hard for a person to be happy if <strong>he or she</strong> does not have a safe place to live and enough food to eat.</span></em></p>

				<p>If you take lessons with an English teacher, I recommend that you ask yourself this question at the end of each lesson:</p>
<p><em>Did I learn some <strong>new language</strong> in this lesson, or did I become <strong>better at using</strong> some language that I already knew?</em></p>
<p>In other words, you are asking yourself whether you worked on your vocabulary <em><strong>range</strong></em> (new words and phrases) or on your <em><strong>flexibility</strong></em> (becoming better at using the language that you already knew).</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> examiners are looking for range and flexibility when they assess your vocabulary in the writing and speaking tests.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Unfortunately, many candidates give <em><strong>shallow</strong></em> answers in their IELTS speaking and writing tests. They mention a few different ideas, but fail to develop any of them in detail. They would get higher scores if they just took one idea and developed it in detail; this is what I call a <strong><em>deep</em></strong> answer.</p>
<p>Practise explaining just one idea in as much detail as you can. The ability to do this could really benefit your speaking and writing scores.</p>

	<p>
				<p>One thing I noticed as an examiner is that many students forget to use simple words like "and" or "but". At the same time, they overuse words like "moreover" and "furthermore".</p>
<p>Native speakers use "and" all the time (in both speech and writing). You can use "and" or "but" as many times as you want; the examiner will not notice!</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you use "moreover" or "furthermore" more than once, the examiner will notice straight away. These words do not get you a high score. In fact, in the speaking exam, they make your English sound 'forced'.</p>

				<p>Question: Which of the following is a correct sentence?</p>
<ol>
<li>Learning a foreign language.</li>
<li>Firstly, learning a foreign language in order to improve your career prospects.</li>
<li>For example, learning a foreign language by living in a country where that language is spoken, and communicating with native speakers on a daily basis.</li>
</ol>
<p>Answer: None of these are correct sentences. None of them has a main verb.</p>
<p>To make a sentence, you need a <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">subject</span> (noun/noun phrase) and a <span style="background-color: #80c0ff;">verb</span>:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">I </span><span style="background-color: #80c0ff;">am learning</span> a foreign language. OR, <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">Learning a foreign language</span> <span style="background-color: #80c0ff;">is</span> useful.</li>
<li>Firstly, <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">many people</span> <span style="background-color: #80c0ff;">learn</span> a foreign language in order to improve their career prospects.</li>

				<p>One of the things that I liked about the presentation in <a href="https://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2018/10/ielts-listening-presentation-about-better-communication.html">this lesson</a> was the idea that 'structures' are so important in any form of communication. When you are speaking or writing (in any context, not just for the IELTS test), the way you structure your ideas makes a difference. A good structure keeps your audience (the listener or reader) interested and on track; it will also add to the coherence, power and persuasiveness of your message.</p>
<p>Consider this example: a sales presentation using a "problem and solution" structure. The sales person explains a problem and then tells the audience how his/her product or service can solve this problem. This simple structure is used in countless advertising and marketing campaigns.</p>
<p>Now let's think about the structures that we use in the IELTS test. Can you list the structures that I've used in my speaking and writing lessons? Here's one example: "answer, explain, example" in part 3 of the speaking test.</p>

	<p>
				<p>For many of the students I've taught, a breakthrough (or big improvement) came when they found the confidence to write and speak in a more 'simple' way.</p>
<p>When you stop worrying about whether you need to use passives, conditionals or 'difficult academic words', you are free to focus on answering the question and explaining your ideas coherently. It takes confidence to change your approach and to believe that the 'simple' way will work.</p>
<p><em>Note: </em>Remember that 'simple' is not the same thing as 'easy'!</p>

	<p>
				<p>On Monday I shared a reading exercise about artificial intelligence. I chose that topic because it seems to be appearing in the news a lot at the moment, with people like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk">Elon Musk</a> saying that they are worried about it.</p>
<p>Perhaps we should prepare some ideas and opinions about artificial intelligence, in case this topic appears in the IELTS test.</p>
<p>Here are some questions to encourage you to prepare ideas:</p>
<ol>
<li>What does artificial intelligence (AI) mean?</li>
<li>Can you give any examples of it?</li>
<li>What benefits might AI bring?</li>
<li>What are the potential drawbacks or dangers?</li>
<li>What is your opinion of AI?</li>

	<p>
				<p>Somebody asked me whether I had a sample answer for the question below, which comes from Cambridge IELTS book 6. I realised I had an old essay that I wrote with some students, so I'm sharing that with you today.</p>
<p><strong><em>Today, the high sales of popular consumer goods reflect the power of advertising and not the real needs of the society in which they are sold. To what extent do you agree or disagree?</em></strong></p>
<p>It is true that we are increasingly surrounded by advertising by companies that want to sell us their products. To some extent I agree that advertising has an impact on sales, but I would also argue that we do need most of the goods that we buy.</p>
<p>Advertisements can certainly tempt people to buy products that they might not otherwise want. A good example could be the mobile phone. Every year people can be seen queuing to buy the latest models, even when they already have a perfectly good phone that does not need replacing. Perhaps it is the influence of marketing that leads us to make these kinds of decisions; we want to stay up to date with the latest fashions or own the newest high-status device. The high sales of the iPhone seem to support this idea.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I believe that most people do not buy products because of the advertising alone. There are other good reasons why we make these choices, and there must be some kind of need before a person makes a purchase. New versions of products almost always have improved features that buyers may want. A new car, for example, may have greatly improved safety features, or it may be more economical to run, or it may pollute less. A new phone may allow the user to communicate more quickly or effectively, thus enhancing their quality of life.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while advertising obviously influences our buying behaviour, I do not agree that people make decisions that go against their real needs.</p>
<p>(261 words)</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong><br>I wrote this essay with my students during a lesson using the students' ideas. I haven't checked it properly, so maybe we can analyse it together. It might not be perfect!</p>

	<p>
				<p>Yesterday I advised you to <em><strong>start slowly</strong></em> when studying something new. Today I'd like to share a short conversation that I had with a student. I think this is a good example of a problem that many students face: they don't take the time to do things slowly and properly!</p>
<p><strong>The student's question:</strong><br>Hi Simon. Brainstorming ideas when I'm writing essays didn't work for me. My essays look better when I'm writing without planning and brainstorming. Should I continue brainstorming until I'm good at it or write without planning. What do you advise?</p>
<p><strong>My answer:</strong><br>My advice is this: whenever you try a new technique, start very slowly. So, try following my planning advice again, but give yourself as much time as you need. It doesn't matter if it takes you an hour to create a good essay plan at first - just aim to get the plan right. Then see what happens when you write an essay using a really good plan. Again, don't give yourself a time limit. When you're comfortable planning and writing in this way, gradually speed up! Perhaps your problem was that you were going too fast.</p>
<p><strong>The student's response:</strong><br>Definitely, yes you are right I'm going too fast and I always place importance on the speed of my writing. The reason I am in a hurry is I think there are lots of topics I need to work on.</p>

				<p>Imagine a musician (pianist, guitarist etc.) who is learning a new technique, or a new piece of music or song. Musicians learn by going slowly at first and gradually speeding up as they become familiar with the technique or music.</p>
<p>I recommend the same when you start preparing for IELTS, or when you learn a new exam technique or study a new topic: start slowly. Try to achieve the score you need at <strong><em>slow speed</em></strong>, and then gradually reduce the time until you can do the same at <strong><em>exam speed</em></strong>.</p>

	<p>
				<p>I've written about this before, but I think it's a message that I need to keep repeating:</p>
<p>Too many candidates approach the IELTS exam with a <em><strong>grammar mindset</strong></em>. They go into the test with their heads full of 'grammatical structures' that they think will impress the examiner. Unfortunately this approach is more likely to hinder you than help you.</p>
<p>I'm trying to persuade people to have a <em><strong>vocabulary mindset</strong></em>. This means that you go into the test knowing that you have prepared ideas for common IELTS topics, and with the aim of expressing your ideas coherently and in as much detail as you can.</p>
<p>Here's a quick question to see which mindset you have:</p>
<p><em><strong>Which of the two activities below do you spend more time doing?</strong></em></p>
<ol>
<li>practising complex sentences, passives and conditionals; learning lists of linking words and phrases; worrying that you make too many mistakes</li>
<li>collecting ideas for IELTS topics and past exam questions; reading and listening to English (not just IELTS related); trying to copy the way native speakers write and speak</li>
</ol>

	<p>
				<p>We've been looking at the following task for several weeks, so I think it's time for a full sample answer.</p>
<p><em><strong>Some people believe that it is more important to teach children the literature and history of their own country, rather than the literature and history of other countries. To what extent do you agree or disagree?</strong></em></p>
<p>People have different views about the teaching of national versus global literature and history in schools. Personally, I support the idea that children should study first and foremost the great books and historical events of their own countries.</p>
<p>There are several reasons why I believe that schools should focus on teaching national literature and history. Firstly, children enjoy learning about where they live, and by studying the ideas, culture and history of their own countries they begin to develop a sense of identity. At the same time, this approach is appealing to parents, who studied the same books and historical events and can therefore help their children with school work. English children, for example, read Shakespeare and learn about the Battle of Hastings just as their parents did, and there is educational continuity across the generations. Finally, an emphasis on national literature and history gives educators a narrower teaching scope, making curriculum design an easier task.</p>
<p>By contrast, the study of global events and foreign novels could cause unnecessary difficulty and confusion for school pupils. For example, I do not see the point in presenting Russian or Chinese history to a British child who has not yet studied the history of his or her own country in detail. Surely the child would be more able to comprehend historical events that took place in London than those that happened in Moscow or Beijing. Similarly, any exposure to international literature is likely to require the teaching of a foreign language or the use of translations. Young people at primary or secondary school age are simply not ready for such complications.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I would argue that it is undesirable for schools to cover aspects of foreign history and literature; they should ground their pupils in the local culture instead.</p>

	<p>
				<p>There is usually a <strong>gap</strong> between the IELTS scores that people get when they practise at home and the scores they get when they take a real test.</p>
<p>For example, maybe you can achieve a band 7 when you write essays without a time limit, but you get a band 6 when you take the test. This is a gap of one band.</p>
<p>Here are some tips relating to this 'performance gap':</p>
<ol>
<li>There should be a gap!</li>
<li>If there isn't a gap, something is wrong with the way you're studying.</li>
<li>If the gap is too big, you're doing something wrong in the exam.</li>
<li>First, try to make the gap bigger through study and learning.</li>
<li>Then try to make the gap smaller by practising in exam conditions.</li>
</ol>
<p>I hope this makes sense! Let me know if you've noticed this gap. How big is it, and what are you doing to make it bigger or smaller?</p>

<li><strong>The child's perspective:</strong> young children like learning about where they live, it makes sense to them</li>
<li><strong>The parent's perspective:</strong> they studied the same books and historical events, they can help their children, there is a sense of continuity across the generations, passing down knowledge</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> reading Shakespeare or learning about the Battle of Hastings in English schools</li>
<li><strong>The school's perspective:</strong> a consistent curriculum of topics, clear limits to teaching scope, easy to visit key locations on school trips</li>

<p><em>When you "brainstorm" ideas for an IELTS essay, what is the number one rule?</em></p>
<p>Only one person gave an answer that was close to what I was looking for. Here's my answer to this question:</p>
<p>The key idea behind "brainstorming" is that you write down <em><strong>anything that comes into your head</strong></em>: good ideas, bad ideas, irrelevant ideas... just write them all down. You can organise them and cross out the bad ones later.</p>
<p>People who forget this 'rule' often get stuck because they are afraid that their ideas aren't good enough. Don't judge yourself at the brainstorming stage.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Try this useful technique for IELTS writing and speaking:</p>
<p><strong>Give an opinion, then follow it with a conditional sentence.</strong></p>
<p>Look at these examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>In my opinion, governments should invest more money in public transport. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">If</span> rail and bus services <span style="text-decoration: underline;">were</span> more reliable, fewer people <span style="text-decoration: underline;">would need</span> to drive.</li>
<li>Schools have an important role to play in children's health. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">If</span> schools <span style="text-decoration: underline;">banned</span> junk food, they <span style="text-decoration: underline;">would help</span> to reduce the problem of childhood obesity.</li>
<li>In the future I think more people will do their shopping online. But <span style="text-decoration: underline;">if</span> Internet shopping <span style="text-decoration: underline;">becomes</span> more popular, many traditional shops <span style="text-decoration: underline;">will lose</span> customers.</li>
</ol>
<p>I've underlined the conditionals. Examples 1 and 2 are second conditionals, while 3 uses the first conditional.</p>
<p><em><strong>Practice:</strong></em><br>Prepare your own "opinion + conditional" ideas for different topics. Having a few of these ideas ready could help you in the writing and speaking tests.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Before I start work on one of the "local vs foreign" questions that we saw in last week's <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2018/08/ielts-writing-task-2-local-vs-foreign-topic.html">lesson</a>, let's consider two things: our <em><strong>real</strong></em> opinion and the <em><strong>easy</strong></em> opinion.</p>
<p>Here's a basic version of the two questions from last week:</p>
<p><em>Is it more important to teach children about local culture (history, literature etc.) than foreign cultures?</em></p>
<p><strong>My real opinion</strong><br>I haven't really thought about this idea before. My instinct seems to be telling me that we should start with local culture. It also seems useful to have some idea of global history, major events that have shaped other countries, the great works of literature from a range of countries. But I'm not sure what the ideal blend of local and global would be, or how teachers could cover such a wide range of material.</p>
<p><strong>The easy opinion</strong><br>Yes. We should focus on the history / literature / culture of our own countries.</p>
<p>I advise students to go for the easy opinion. Your real opinion is often too complex or <em><strong>nuanced*</strong></em> for the demands of a 250-word essay! We'll start work on an "easy opinion" essay next Wednesday.</p>
<p>*<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Look this word up in a dictionary or on Google if you're not sure what I mean.</span></p>

	<p>
				<p>Here are two exam questions that students have asked me about recently:</p>
<p><strong>Question 1</strong><br>It is more important to learn about local history than foreign history. To what extent do you agree or disagree?</p>
<p><strong>Question 2</strong><br>Some people believe that it is more important to teach children the literature of their own country, rather than that of other countries. To what extent do you agree or disagree?</p>
<p>These two questions are essentially the same, so I think we can work on them both at the same time. Let's start with our overall opinion: Do you agree that we should place more importance on learning about our own countries / cultures?</p>

	<p>
				<p>If you want to become a better essay writer, I advise you to forget the idea of learning lists of 'difficult' or 'academic' words.</p>
<p>Here's the alternative approach that I recommend:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Do more reading</strong></em>, and make a note of the 'natural'&nbsp;<a href="https://www.englishclub.com/vocabulary/collocations.htm">collocations</a> and phrases that native speakers use. You'll find many of these in the lessons on this site.</li>
<li>Also, instead of always learning new words, try to become <strong><em>better at using</em></strong> the words you already know. For example, did you know that we use the words 'shoulder' and 'responsibility' together ? e.g. "<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">It is true that parents shoulder a huge responsibility</span>" from <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2018/08/ielts-writing-task-2-parenting-course-essay.html">this essay</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's the simple way to understand the advice above: focus on <em><strong>phrases</strong></em> instead of individual words. Communication is about using words <em><strong>together</strong></em>.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: small;"><em><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; -moz-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">I often wonder why so many people look for vocabulary websites when they have one right under their noses: ielts-simon.com. If you went through all the lessons Simon has posted over the years and picked up all the great words and phrases along the way, I'm sure you'd be well on your way to getting band 7+ in IELTS.</span></em></span></p>

	<h4><a href="https://www.ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2018/08/ielts-writing-task-2-parenting-course-essay.html">IELTS Writing Task 2: 'parenting course' essay</a></h4>
	<p>
				<p>Here's my full essay for the question below.</p>
<p><em><strong>Caring for children is probably the most important job in any society. Because of this, all mothers and fathers should be required to take a course that prepares them to be good parents. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this view?</strong></em></p>
<p>It is true that parents shoulder a huge responsibility and that raising children is by no means an easy task. However, I completely disagree with the idea that we should therefore force all mothers and fathers to attend parenting courses.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the idea that all future parents should take a parenthood preparation course is completely impractical. Many prospective parents have jobs and busy schedules, and they may not be willing or able to attend regular parenting classes. This raises the question of whether those who missed the classes, or perhaps refused to attend, would be punished. I believe that it would be wrong to do this, and it would therefore be impossible to enforce the idea of compulsory training for parents. Besides, even if parents could be forced to attend, I doubt that people would agree on what good parenting entails, and so it would be difficult to create a parenting course to suit everyone.</p>
<p>As well as being impractical, I would argue that training courses for parents are unnecessary. Mothers and fathers have been raising children without any formal help or official interference for thousands of years. Parenting skills are learnt from family members, friends, neighbours and the surrounding culture. Perhaps more importantly, adults learn to be good parents by instinct, by trial and error, and by getting to know their own children; for example, a good parent will try different strategies when faced with a badly-behaved child, and will gradually develop an understanding of what works to correct the behaviour. None of this requires the intervention of a taught course.</p>

	<p>
				<p>I've written before about students'&nbsp;<a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2010/11/ielts-grammar-moreover-doesnt-get-you-a-7.html" target="_self" title="">overuse</a> of the word 'Moreover' and why I would <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2013/10/ielts-advice-words-that-i-would-ban.html" target="_self" title="">ban</a> it. But for some reason, many people still believe that 'Moreover' will help them to get a high score.</p>
<p>Here's a trick that I sometimes use to demonstrate to my students that 'Moreover' isn't the key to a high score: Teach me the word for 'Moreover' in your language. If a beginner like me can learn it, it can't be such a difficult word!</p>

	<p>
				<p>Students often ask me to explain why their scores have dropped. For example, one student got a band 7 in speaking last month, but his speaking score dropped to 6 this month. How is that possible?</p>
<p>You might think that the examiner has been too strict or has done something wrong, but this is probably not the case. The best explanation for fluctuating IELTS scores is <em><strong>performance on the day</strong></em>.</p>
<p>Some days you perform well: the topics in the exam seem to suit you, your brain seems to find good answers and remember good words or phrases, and you finish all parts of the test in the time allowed. Other days nothing seems to go right; you simply have a bad day.</p>
<p>Don't worry if your score fluctuates; this is completely normal. One day everything will go perfectly, and you'll get the scores you need!</p>
<p>Note: Your scores will also fluctuate if you keep changing the 'method' that you use.</p>

<p>Here's my solution to this problem: stop using so many different books and websites! Choose one website, or one book, or one teacher, and follow one consistent method. If you read contradictory advice in a different book, ignore it - it's just a different method.</p>

<p><em><strong>Caring for children is probably the most important job in any society. Because of this, all mothers and fathers should be required to take a course that prepares them to be good parents. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this view?</strong></em></p>

<p><em>It is true that parents shoulder a huge responsibility and that raising children is by no means an easy task. However, I completely disagree with the idea that we should therefore force all mothers and fathers to attend parenting courses.</em></p>
<p>How to write a conclusion:</p>

				<p>People often argue that "there's no best method" with regard to learning a language, or perhaps with regard to IELTS preparation.</p>
<p>While I agree with the "no best method" idea to a large extent, I believe that we should add to this statement:</p>

<p>And perhaps we could add a bit more:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't keep changing methods. Find one that works and stick to it.</li>
<li>Trust the method of an 'expert' e.g. your teacher or someone who has already been successful.</li>

	<p>
				<p>I received a useful question from another IELTS teacher this week. Here's a summary of what the teacher asked me:</p>
<p>The IELTS-Simon approach to writing task 2 is very prescriptive (strict and always the same): always 4 paragraphs, 13 sentences etc. But what do you think about giving students a more flexible approach to IELTS writing task 2? For example, might it sometimes be better to write 5 paragraphs instead of 4?</p>
<p>Here's a summary of my response:</p>
<p>The more you try to teach your students to be flexible, the more you risk confusing them and making them less decisive and efficient when they find themselves under pressure on test day. I've found that students perform better if they know exactly what to do every time they write an essay. The prescriptive approach seems to work better than a flexible approach.</p>

				<p>In Thursday's lesson I wrote this: "Traffic will be diverted <em><strong>on to</strong></em> a dual carriageway".</p>

<p>Here's the answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>When the meaning is <em><strong>'to a position on the surface of'</strong></em>, we can use the single word <em><strong>'onto'</strong></em> e.g. The child climbed onto the chair.</li>
<li>But if the meaning is <em><strong>'onwards'</strong></em> or <em><strong>'towards'</strong></em>, we should use the two words <em><strong>'on to'</strong></em>. In my example ("on to a dual carriageway"), the meaning was 'towards', not 'to a position on the surface of'.</li>

	<p>
				<p><em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Note: I'm re-posting this lesson because people keep asking me about 'difficult' words.</span></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Here's a useful question from a student who asked about "difficult" words and how to learn new vocabulary:</strong></em></p>
<p>Hi Simon. Reading your blog and studying your ebook, I’ve noticed your English is perfect, but you don’t use difficult words. Also, regarding the process of learning new words, some teachers say that we should write them on cards and write the adjective, noun, verb associated with the new word. Do you think this is a good idea?</p>
<p><em><strong>Here's my answer:</strong></em></p>
<p>I don't believe in the idea of a "difficult word" - any individual word can be learnt easily. What is difficult is using words together in phrases. So, I tell my students not to write down individual words, but to investigate how words work in real contexts. Instead of writing single words on cards, I'd write phrases or even sentences in a notebook. It's definitely a good idea to look for associated nouns, verbs and adjectives, but always try to find examples of how those words are used (just search for them on the Internet). Remember: it's easy to understand a word, but it's not so easy to use it in a range of full sentence contexts.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Model essays can be extremely useful because they show you what you are aiming for, and they contain good vocabulary and correct grammar. However, the model essays in some IELTS books seem to confuse students because they are written in too many different ways (so the 'method' isn't clear).</p>
<p>Although there is no 'right way' to write an essay, I think that you should find <em><strong>one</strong></em> way and stick with it. If you read a model essay that is written in a different way, don't worry! Use the essay for ideas and vocabulary, but don't change your method. Maybe you could even rewrite the model essay using <em><strong>your</strong></em> method.</p>

<p>And here's my 5-sentence paragraph using the ideas above:</p>
<p>In my opinion, the idea that all future parents should take a parenthood preparation course is completely impractical. Many prospective parents have jobs and busy schedules, and they may not be willing or able to attend regular parenting classes. This raises the question of whether those who missed the classes, or perhaps refused to attend, would be punished. I believe that it would be wrong to do this, and it would therefore be impossible to enforce the idea of compulsory training for parents. Besides, even if parents could be forced to attend, I doubt that people would agree on what good parenting entails, and so it would be difficult to create a parenting course to suit everyone.</p>
<p>Try using the plan in last week's lesson to create paragraph 2 in the same way.</p>

	<p>
				<p>A student asked me about the use of 'being' in the following sentence.</p>
<p><em>"There is a danger of nuclear weapons <span style="text-decoration: underline;">being</span> obtained by terrorists."</em></p>
<p>Here's my (updated) explanation:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, imagine that the simplest version of this sentence is this: <span style="color: #7f007f;"><strong>"There is a danger of x"</strong></span> (in which x is a noun).</li>
<li>Now we can consider <span style="color: #7f007f;"><strong>"nuclear weapons being obtained by terrorists"</strong></span> as a big noun phrase.</li>
<li>The <span style="color: #7f007f;"><strong>"being obtained"</strong></span> part of this phrase can be called a passive gerund. It is not a verb or verb phrase, so the word "are" (are being) is <em><strong>not</strong></em> missing and cannot be added.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: When we use the phrase "there is a danger of...", there is a future implication. So, "there is a danger of x" means "there is a danger that x will happen".</p>
<p>Therefore, our sentence really means this:<br>- There is a danger that nuclear weapons <em><strong>will be</strong></em> obtained by terrorists" OR<br>- There is a danger that terrorists will obtain nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>Thanks to Morteza and Oleg for pushing me towards a better explanation!</p>

				<p>Let's start work on a new writing topic. Here's a recent exam question that a student sent me:</p>
<p><em><strong>Caring for children is probably the most important job in any society. Because of this, all mothers and fathers should be required to take a course that prepares them to be good parents. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this view?</strong></em></p>

	<p>
				<p>In the comments below a recent lesson, I noticed that several people had written "I'm agree with you". This is incorrect.</p>
<p>You can't say "I'm agree" in English. You must say <strong>"I agree"</strong>.</p>
<p>I think this mistake is caused by people translating from their own languages. For example, I know that in French and Spanish, the verb 'be' is used when people want to say that they agree, so it looks something like "I am agree" or "I am agreed". It's not the same in English.</p>
<p>In English, we simply use 'agree' as a <strong>normal verb</strong>: I agree, I prefer, I like...</p>

	<p>
				<p>In Thursday's lesson I told you <em><strong>not</strong></em> to use words like <em>soar, rocket, shoot up, creep up, dive</em> and <em>plummet</em> in IELTS writing task 1.</p>
<p><strong>But what's wrong with those words?</strong></p>
<p>The problem with those words is that they are <em>too figurative</em> for writing task 1. Think about the normal use of these verbs (e.g. the bird soared into the air, the climber plummeted to his death). If you use these words to describe figures on a graph, it seems too sensational or exaggerated. This is why I prefer to stick with <em>increase, decrease, rise</em> and <em>fall</em>.</p>
<p><strong>So can we ever use these words to describe figures?</strong></p>
<p>If you're writing for a newspaper, yes you can! You'll often see phrases like this in newspapers: house prices soared, share prices plummeted, the price of petrol crept up. Newspapers and magazines love idiomatic and descriptive language, but this style does not suit academic graph descriptions.</p>

	<p>
				<p><strong>Note:</strong> I don't normally give the following advice to IELTS students. However, I think it's an interesting idea to consider.</p>
<p>Did you know that <em><strong>some</strong></em> professional English writers try to avoid using adverbs? Let's look at some examples to understand why they might do this.</p>
<p><strong>1) Sometimes the adverb is unnecessary. Compare these two phrases:</strong></p>
<p>- It is true that<br>- It is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">certainly</span> true that</p>
<p>I often use the second phrase in my essays, but you could argue that the word "certainly" is redundant. If something is true, it's true! Do we really need to emphasise it?</p>
<p><strong>2) Sometimes a single word is more descriptive:</strong></p>
<p>- This is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">very</span> important = This is essential, vital, crucial<br>- This is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">really</span> difficult = This is complicated, complex, problematic, challenging</p>
<p>For our purposes, I think the second point above is more useful, because it encourages you to use a wider range of vocabulary to express ideas.</p>
<p>Remember: There's nothing wrong with using adverbs in the IELTS writing test. I just think it's interesting to consider the alternatives.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Someone asked me this question the other day: Why do you use a blog to teach IELTS?</p>
<p>Here's my answer:</p>
<p>The advantage of a blog is that it can keep going and going (unlike a book or a course). Over the years, this blog has evolved as I've learnt more about students' problems, and as I've gradually refined my IELTS preparation methods.</p>
<p>The disadvantage of the blog is that the lessons aren't in a particular order, so there isn't a starting point or a step-by-step progression. However, I find this lack of structure interesting. I don't think we always need to study in a perfectly organised way. Perhaps the act of searching through the lessons and reading them <em><strong>in your own unique order</strong></em> makes the study process more engaging and creative.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Instead of writing five different essays, have you considered rewriting <strong><em>one</em></strong> essay <em><strong>five times</strong></em>?</p>
<p>Most people don't like rewriting essays because it seems boring. And the people who do rewrite essays usually only do this because they need to correct grammar mistakes.</p>
<p>But <em><strong>good rewriting</strong></em> is about more than just grammar corrections; there are many other things that you could improve, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>how well you address the question</li>
<li>clarity of your position</li>
<li>sentences or phrases that are vague or irrelevant</li>
<li>level of detail in your explanations</li>
<li>overall paragraph structure</li>
<li>paragraph <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2015/08/ielts-advice-paragraph-movement.html">movement</a></li>
<li>coherence between neighbouring sentences</li>
<li>repetition and variety of vocabulary</li>
<li>use of connectives to link sentence clauses</li>
<li>anything else that <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2018/04/ielts-advice-tighten-up-your-writing.html">'tightens up'</a> your writing</li>
</ul>
<p>Imagine how much you could learn if you rewrote one essay five times (or more!) to address all of these areas.</p>
<p><strong>Warning 1:</strong><br>You'll need help from a teacher to do this properly. Show him or her this lesson so that you both understand what you're aiming to do.</p>
<p><strong>Warning 2:</strong><br>This is the kind of hard work that most people aren't prepared to do. But it's the kind of work that yields real results!</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here's my full essay for the question that we looked at a couple of weeks ago.</p>
<p><em><strong>Some people think that employers should not care about the way their employees dress, because what matters is the quality of their work. To what extent do you agree or disagree?</strong></em></p>
<p>In the modern workplace, dress codes are changing as employers focus more on results than on the rules that employees must follow. While I agree that the way people dress should be seen as irrelevant in many work contexts, I believe that dress codes still exist for good reason in certain professions.</p>
<p>On the one hand, many employers have stopped telling their staff how to dress, and I see this as a positive trend. Some of the most successful companies in the world, including technology giants like Google and Facebook, are famous for the relaxed office environments that they try to create. Employees are encouraged to dress casually, and even the company executives and leaders are rarely seen wearing anything other than T-shirts and jeans. However, while managers and programmers are free to dress how they like, they are expected to produce work of outstanding quality. It is clear from the performance and global dominance of such companies that strict dress codes are completely unnecessary in the technology sector.</p>
<p>However, I would also argue that rules regarding employees' clothing are still relevant in other work situations. We expect certain professionals, such as nurses, police officers and airline pilots, to wear uniforms. These uniforms may have a practical or safety function, but perhaps more importantly they identify the person’s position or role in society. Similarly, a lawyer, politician or school principal may choose to wear formal clothing in order to portray an image of authority, trustworthiness and diligence. I believe that most of us prefer to see these professionals in smart, formal attire, even if it is not strictly necessary.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I support the trend towards relaxed dress codes for workers, but I do not see it as applicable to all occupations or sectors of the economy.</p>

<li>They don't take the time to think about the question before they start writing.</li>
<li>They don't spend enough time planning. A few ideas are not enough; a good essay plan should be detailed and organised. Do some "clear thinking" before you start writing!</li>
<li>They are thinking about the big words, complex grammar and memorised phrases that they hope to use in the essay, instead of thinking about how to answer the question. You can't think clearly about the question if your brain is focused on these other things.</li>
<li>They are thinking clearly in their own languages, but they are not able to translate these ideas into 'natural' English.</li>
</ol>
<p>Can you see how important 'clear thinking' is? Everything that you write is a manifestation of the thoughts in your head. In other words, your writing demonstrates exactly how clear your thinking is.</p>

	<p>
				<p>On Tuesday I used part of a very interesting speech by a university professor. I could sum up his message in this way:</p>
<p><em>There's no difference between thinking and writing. We should teach people to write well so that they learn to think well.</em></p>
<p>Of course, the opposite must also be true: If you want to <strong><em>write</em></strong> clearly and coherently, you need to <em><strong>think</strong></em> clearly and coherently.</p>
<p>Ask yourself this: When I'm writing an IELTS essay, does my thinking feel clear, coherent and organised? Or do I feel confused and disorganised?</p>

	<p>
				<p>I often use the phrasal verb 'tighten up' when I'm talking about improving essays. Here's what I mean when I use this verb:</p>
<p>- Make your writing clear, concise and succinct<br>- Remove anything that is irrelevant or vague<br>- Avoid unnecessary repetition<br>- Check that each sentence follows on logically from the sentence before it<br>- Make sure that your sentences&nbsp;<a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2015/08/ielts-advice-paragraph-movement.html">move your paragraphs forward</a></p>
<p>Think about the job of an editor (for a newspaper, magazine or book publisher). Editors check other people's writing and "tighten it up" so that it's easier to read. This is what you should try to do with your own writing.</p>

<p><strong>Paragraph topic: employers should not care how employees dress</strong></p>
<p>On the one hand, many employers have stopped telling their staff how to dress, and I see this as a positive trend. <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">Some of the most successful companies in the world, including technology giants like Google and Facebook</span>, are famous for the relaxed office environments that they try to create. Employees are encouraged to dress casually, and even the company executives and leaders are rarely seen wearing anything other than T-shirts and jeans. However, while managers and programmers are free to dress how they like, they are expected to produce work of outstanding quality. It is clear from the performance and global dominance of such companies that strict dress codes are completely unnecessary in the technology sector.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong><br><em>Some people think that employers should not care about the way their employees dress, because what matters is the quality of their work. To what extent do you agree or disagree?</em></p>

<p><strong>Topic sentence, paragraph 2</strong><br>On the one hand, many employers have stopped telling their staff how to dress, and I see this as a positive trend.</p>
<p><strong>Topic sentence, paragraph 3</strong><br>However, I would also argue that rules regarding employees' clothing are still relevant or necessary in other work situations.</p>

	<p>
				<p>When people ask me for general advice about how to improve their IELTS scores, the first thing that I say to them is: you need a method for everything.</p>
<p>Do you have a method or a way of approaching <em><strong>every</strong></em> part of the test? If you don't have a method, you're not as well prepared as you could be.</p>

	<p>
				<p>If you want to get a band 7 or higher for 'task response' (which is 25% of your task 2 score), your "position" needs to be clear "throughout the response".</p>
<p>The means that you need to answer the question clearly and directly in your introduction, explain and support your answer in the main body paragraphs, and repeat (paraphrase) or summarise your answer in the conclusion.</p>
<p>Look at the three introductions below. Do all three of them present a clear "position"? Which introduction would you prefer to use?</p>
<p><strong>Here's the question again:</strong><br><em>Some people think that employers should not care about the way their employees dress, because what matters is the quality of their work. To what extent do you agree or disagree?</em></p>
<p><strong>Introduction 1</strong><br>In the modern workplace, dress codes are changing as employers focus more on results than on the rules that employees must follow. There are strong arguments for both points of view.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction 2</strong><br>In the modern workplace, dress codes are changing as employers focus more on results than on the rules that employees must follow. I completely agree with the view that workers should be judged on their work alone, and that they should be allowed to dress however they want.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction 3</strong><br>In the modern workplace, dress codes are changing as employers focus more on results than on the rules that employees must follow. While I agree that the way people dress should be seen as irrelevant in many work contexts, I believe that dress codes still exist for good reason in certain professions.</p>

To what extent do you agree or disagree?</em></p>
<p>Here's my suggestion: start by thinking of <em><strong>real examples</strong></em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Are there any companies that allow employees to dress casually or wear whatever clothes they want? Yes. Technology companies like Google and Facebook are famous for their relaxed dress codes. They aim to create an informal, fun and creative environment.</li>
<li>Now let's think about the opposite: In which jobs would casual clothes seem strange or inappropriate? Perhaps we could write about doctors, lawyers, teachers or even sales people. We usually expect these people to dress in a smart and professional manner.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think these examples help us to see that the way employees dress <em><strong>depends</strong> <strong>on</strong> <strong>the type of company or job</strong></em>. This is a good way to give a balanced answer.</p>

	<p>
				<p>In last Sunday's <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2018/03/ielts-advice-work-on-your-weaknesses.html">lesson</a> I suggested that you identify and work on your weaknesses. It's not always easy to identify your own weaknesses, so here are three tips to help you to expose them:</p>
<ol>
<li>Break each part of the test into smaller tasks. For example, you could spend time working on multiple choice questions in the reading test, idea generation for speaking part 2 (see yesterday's lesson), trend descriptions for writing task 1, or main body paragraphs for writing task 2. If you practise "small pieces" of the test, it's likely that you'll discover which "pieces" are problematic.</li>
<li>Put yourself under pressure. Some people only discover their weaknesses on the day of their real IELTS tests. A good way to create this kind of pressure at home is to give yourself less time than normal. For example, you could try to write a task 2 essay in just 30 minutes, finish a reading test in 50 minutes, or do a full listening test with no breaks (i.e. fast forward the recording every time there is a break). Going too quickly will expose your weak points, and then you can go back and analyse them.</li>
<li>Ask a teacher. If nothing else seems to work, you'll need to get some feedback from a teacher. Ask your teacher to identify the main weaknesses that are stopping you from getting a higher score.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Be careful with point 2 above. It's fine to test yourself or "go too quickly" <strong><em>occasionally</em></strong>, as a way to expose weaknesses, but you should spend most of your time preparing slowly and carefully.</p>

	<p>
				<p>A student asked me to suggest how we could write a balanced answer to the following question.</p>
<p><em>Some people think that employers should not care about the way their employees dress, because what matters is the quality of their work. To what extent do you agree or disagree?</em></p>
<p>Can we write a balanced answer? How?</p>

	<p>
				<p>It's often the case that just one particular weakness is stopping people from getting a higher score. For example, the student that I wrote about yesterday had a problem with idea generation. His English was very good, but he struggled to think of good ideas, especially when under pressure.</p>
<p>I told him to stop writing essays and to spend time working only on his weakness (as described yesterday). In other words, we <em><strong>identified</strong></em> a weakness, we <em><strong>isolated</strong></em> it, and then we came up with a simple <em><strong>action plan</strong></em> to tackle it. Perhaps you can do the same.</p>

	<p>
				<p>I got chatting to a student in a café the other day, and he told me that his big problem was not being able to think of good ideas for writing task 2.</p>
<p>When I asked the student about how he practised for this part of the test, it became clear that he wasn't working on his weakness. He wasn't practising idea generation.</p>
<p>So here's a summary of the advice that I gave the student:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, watch my <a href="http://subscriptions.viddler.com/SimonCorcoran/fkvcqe">video lesson</a> about planning ideas.</li>
<li>Then print a big list of questions, like <span class="asset  asset-generic at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c01bb09fe099c970d img-responsive"><a href="http://ielts-simon.com/files/question-list.pdf">this one</a>.</span></li>
<li><span class="asset  asset-generic at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c01bb09fe099c970d img-responsive">The next time you're sitting in a café, take your list out and try brainstorming ideas for two or three of the questions.</span></li>
<li><span class="asset  asset-generic at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c01bb09fe099c970d img-responsive">Don't write an essay or even any sentences. Just note down ideas on a piece of paper.</span></li>
<li><span class="asset  asset-generic at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c01bb09fe099c970d img-responsive">If you can't think of good ideas in English, try thinking in your own language. Don't translate the ideas into English at this stage. Your only aim is to turn on the creative part of your brain!</span></li>
<li><span class="asset  asset-generic at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c01bb09fe099c970d img-responsive">Start with your real opinion. Ask yourself what you really think about the topic; if you were debating the topic with a friend, what would you say?</span></li>
<li><span class="asset  asset-generic at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c01bb09fe099c970d img-responsive">Start with examples. If the topic is 'unhealthy food', think about McDonald's or Coca Cola. If the topic is 'work', think about doctors, teachers, computer programmers etc.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="asset  asset-generic at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c01bb09fe099c970d img-responsive">Imagine spending 15 minutes each day just thinking of ideas, questioning your own opinions, and making notes on a wide range of IELTS topics. With practice, I'm sure you can turn a weakness into a strength!</span></p>

				<p>Last week I showed you the following 'mental picture' of a task 2 essay:</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c01b8d2e44403970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="6a0120a5bb05d8970c01b7c9582b53970b-400wi" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c01b8d2e44403970c img-responsive" src="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c01b8d2e44403970c-500wi" title="6a0120a5bb05d8970c01b7c9582b53970b-400wi"></a></p>
<p>Here's what I was trying to represent:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are 13 coloured lines to represent 13 sentences.</li>
<li>The white spaces separate the 4 paragraphs (2, 5, 5 1 sentence structure).</li>
<li>The purple lines are my 'essay skeleton': introduction, main paragraph topic sentences, conclusion.</li>
<li>The grey lines indicate a 'one idea' paragraph. The topic sentence is followed by 4 sentences that develop the same central idea.</li>
<li>Paragraph 3 could be a 'Firstly, Secondly, Finally' paragraph. The orange lines represent the first idea and perhaps an example or further explanation. The blue line will be a second supporting idea, and the green line is the final point.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the basic 'blueprint' that I have in my head when I'm writing an essay. It really helps to have a clear mental image like this. Otherwise it's like travelling without a map; who knows where you'll end up!</p>

	<p>
				<p>Many students are concerned that the language they use might be too 'simple', so they try to find more 'difficult' words or phrases.</p>
<p>In my opinion, words and phrases are never 'difficult' in the way that a subject like mathematics can be difficult. Anyone can understand and learn a word or phrase. What <em><strong>is</strong></em> difficult about learning a language is <em><strong>building a large&nbsp;<a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2011/10/ielts-advice-your-repertoire.html">repertoire</a></strong></em> of words and phrases that you can use flexibly to express a wide variety of ideas.</p>
<p>Examiners don't really think in terms of 'simple' and 'difficult'. They look for:</p>
<ul>
<li>range and variety of vocabulary</li>
<li>detailed explanation of relevant ideas</li>
<li>ability to put groups of words together correctly (e.g. collocation)</li>
<li>accurate use of small words (e.g. articles) as well as big words</li>

	<p>
				<p>Yesterday I mentioned that people are writing some really intelligent comments below lessons here on the blog. Today I'd like to share a comment written by Kali. I think this is a great example of 'deep work'.</p>
<p>Kali took five of my task 2 essays and shared the following analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each essay averaged 13 sentences, the longest 32 words, the shortest 10 words.</li>
<li>One in three sentences was complex in the sense that it contained a subordinate, noun, or relative clause.</li>
<li>On average ONE of the following: "Though/although", "because", "whereas", "while", "whilst",or "if" occurred ONCE per essay.</li>
<li>"In conclusion" ONCE per essay.</li>
<li>"Also" almost ONCE per essay.</li>
<li>Either "On the other hand" or "however" ONCE per essay.</li>
<li>"This" (as a cohesion device) in two out of five essays.</li>
<li>"but" occurred on average once or twice per essay.</li>
<li>"or" comes up about twice per essay.</li>
<li>"and" seven times per essay on average.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's Kali's summary of the above analysis:</p>
<p><em>In my view, what this demonstrates is that Simon's writing is both normal, and that its simplicity is deceptive. There is comparatively little reliance on connective adverbs, such as "moreover" or "consequently", at the start of sentences. Although some sentences are technically and grammatically more complex, the complexity passes unnoticed to the average reader.</em></p>
<p>If you find this kind of analysis useful, read the third comment below <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2018/01/ielts-writing-task-1-paraphrasing-practice.html">this lesson</a> (written by csaj). This is a great example of how Google Books and Ngrams can help us.</p>

				<p>Did you quickly scan through this week's lessons here on the blog, or did you spend the time to do some 'deep work'? For example: Did you write all of the useful vocabulary in a notebook? Did you analyse my task 1 and task 2 paragraphs carefully, looking at organisation, coherence, grammar and word choice?</p>
<p>If you read through my lessons quickly, I'm sure you'll pick up some useful tips. But if you go deeper, you'll learn a lot more!</p>

	<p>
				<p><em><strong>Is it always a good thing to work hard?</strong></em></p>
<p>Here's my plan for a 5-sentence paragraph to answer this question:</p>
<ol>
<li>Topic sentence - hard work is <em><strong>usually</strong></em> seen as positive</li>
<li>Explain why - education: pass exams, good grades, career progression</li>
<li>Explain why - employment: most industrious people rise to the top</li>
<li>However - it can become an obsession with perfection, competition</li>
<li>Result - neglecting family relationships, stressed, irritable</li>
</ol>
<p>And here's my paragraph:</p>
<p>When a person is described as hard-working, this is almost always seen as a positive trait or attitude. In the realm of education, we expect hard workers to diligently follow instructions, pass their exams, achieve good grades and take their first steps on the path to a successful career. Similarly, in an employment setting, we expect the most motivated, industrious and committed individuals to rise to the top and become leaders or experts in their fields. However, I believe that in some people the desire to work hard can become an unhealthy obsession with perfection, outcompeting others or being the best. When people work so hard that they neglect family and relationships or become stressed and irritable, a positive trait has surely become detrimental.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Native speakers instinctively know which words work well together. In our native languages, we don't usually need to think about grammar because we have a vast store of 'correct' collocations and phrases in our heads; some people refer to these as 'chunks' of language. It's incredible how quickly our brains are able to retrieve these 'chunks' and piece them together to form sentences and express ideas.</p>
<p>Unfortunately most of us don't use our brains in this way when we're learning a second language. We learn grammar rules and individual words, and we fall into the trap of translating from our native languages. As a result, we often make the wrong word choices and produce 'unnatural collocations'.</p>
<p>Part of the solution to this problem, in my view, is to become a collocations collector! Collect groups of words that native speakers actually use (see yesterday's lesson for some examples). Write them in a notebook, reread them regularly, and try to use them when you're speaking or writing,</p>
<p><em>Note: How many collocations can you find in the paragraphs above?</em></p>

	<p>
				<p>Continuing with the question from <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2018/02/ielts-writing-task-2-two-part-question-plan.html">this lesson</a>, let's write a paragraph about <em><strong>why some people work harder than others</strong></em>.</p>
<p>First, here's a quick plan for a 5-sentence paragraph:</p>
<ul>
<li>Three main reasons why some people work harder</li>
<li>1) Parental pressure to be studious and successful </li>
<li>Example: medical students do not want to disappoint family members</li>
<li>2) Escape from poverty or create a new life</li>
<li>3) Found a subject or job that they love</li>
</ul>
<p>Now here's my paragraph, using the ideas above:</p>
<p>In my experience, there are three main factors that influence how hard people study or work. One key factor that drives people and makes them more studious and goal-oriented is parental pressure. Some medical students, for example, are motivated to study hard because they do not wish to disappoint family members who expect them to graduate successfully and become doctors. On the other hand, there are people who see hard work as a means to escape poverty or create a completely new life for themselves. Finally, it seems to me that some people are more driven and persistent as students or workers simply because they have found a subject or job that they truly enjoy; people who love their work describe it as effortless rather than hard.</p>

<p><em><strong>In education and employment, some people work harder than others. Why do some people work harder? Is it always a good thing to work hard?</strong></em></p>

<li>Main paragraph: Answer the second question.</li>
<li>Conclusion: Summarise the answer to both questions.</li>
</ol>
<p>To get the essay started, here's a possible introduction:</p>
<p>It is true that some people are hard-working and diligent while others prefer not to push themselves, and there could be various reasons for these different attitudes. In my view, a positive work ethic is desirable up to a point, but too much hard work can be counterproductive and even unhealthy.</p>

	<p>
				<p>It was interesting to read about people's procrastination problems in the comments below last Saturday's <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2018/02/ielts-advice-procrastination.html">lesson</a>. I think we all experience these problems when we're trying to do something difficult.</p>
<p>Here are five tips that help me to fight procrastination:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Just make a start.</strong> If you've been procrastinating about writing an essay, for example, make it your goal to write the first sentence only. The hardest thing is to get started, and the idea of writing a full essay can be daunting. Put this idea out of your mind, and focus instead on writing just one sentence.</li>
<li><strong>Find a nice place.</strong> Whenever I have some difficult writing to do, I find it much easier to get started if I'm sitting in a café with a cup of coffee. It doesn't feel like such hard work when you're in a nice environment.</li>
<li><strong>Aim lower (at first).</strong> Sometimes our frustration is caused by the high expectations that we have. Instead of jumping into a 10-hour-a-day study programme, it's better to start with 10 minutes, then gradually do more each day.</li>
<li><strong>Get some help.</strong> It's hard to study alone, so try to find a study partner, teacher or someone who can occasionally check your progress and give you advice.</li>
<li><strong>Form a daily habit.</strong> For me, doing something every day is the ultimate weapon in the fight against procrastination. Doing something once a week (or even 5 times a week) doesn't work as well. There's something magic about daily practice: when a daily action becomes as normal as brushing your teeth, big changes start to happen!</li>

	<p>
				<p>I'll share some tips on beating procrastination next weekend, but I thought I'd say just one thing about it today, and it's something positive.</p>
<p>The positive thing about procrastination is that <em><strong>it tells you what is important.</strong></em> The more you procrastinate and leave something for later, the more important that task probably is in your life. So, let your procrastinating guide you towards what needs to be done, and begin to confront that task now. You'll feel much better if you do.</p>

				<p>Do you find it difficult to study as much as you would like to? Perhaps you make study plans but then decide to "do it later". This is what we call 'procrastination'.</p>
<p>Most of us procrastinate, put things off, or tell ourselves that we'll do it later, especially when the task is difficult and we feel stuck.</p>

	<p>
				<p>I always tell my students to choose a method and stick to it. For main paragraphs, I teach them two easy ways to organise their ideas:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Idea, explain, example:</strong> If you have one main idea, this easy format will help you to build a good paragraph. To see an example, look at paragraph 3 in <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2017/06/ielts-writing-task-2-homework-essay.html">this essay</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Firstly, secondly, finally:</strong> If you have two or three ideas, just use this format. Miss the "finally" if you only have two ideas, and remember that you can use alternative words for the same structure (e.g. The main reason, another reason, also, furthermore).

<ul>
<li>the amount of time that you can use for study each day</li>

				<p>Many people ask me about the difference between an 'argument' (opinion) essay and a 'discussion' essay. Here's an easy way to think about the difference:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you argue, you are trying to persuade the other person to agree with your point of view. You might even get angry!</li>
<li>When you discuss, you consider different points of view, and nobody gets angry.</li>
</ul>
<p>The question should make it very clear what it wants you to do. If it asks you to "discuss", you should write about both sides or two views.</p>
<p>If the question asks whether you "agree or disagree", it's asking for <em><strong>your</strong></em> view. For this type of question, give your opinion in the introduction and support it in the rest of the essay. Develop an argument that persuades the reader to agree with you. Note: you can have a strong view or a balanced view - it's your choice.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; -moz-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">The deeper answer:</span></strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">Remember that I use 'firstly, secondly, finally' almost like a <strong>label</strong>, to identify a particular type of paragraph (one with a topic sentence and three supporting ideas). It's fine to change the linking words, but the paragraph style should stay the same.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">It is <strong><em>not</em></strong> <em><strong>true</strong></em> that examiners consider 'firstly, secondly, finally' to be "overused". These are just simple linking words that do a useful job. Most linking words (e.g. and, but, because, while, if) are very easy and very commonly used, but we still need them.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">You won't get a higher score by using bigger linking words that seem more impressive. For example, there's nothing difficult or impressive about the word 'moreover'. Why waste your time looking for more original linking words if they don't exist?</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">If you want a really high score, read <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2015/02/ielts-writing-task-2-band-9-linking.html">this lesson</a> about 'band 9 linking'.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">Instead of worrying about linking, spend your time working on 'topic vocabulary' (like the list of phrases <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2018/01/ielts-vocabulary-review-of-this-week.html">here</a>). This is what will impress the examiner.</span></li>

	<p>
				<p>Let's return to the 'young population' question that you can see in <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2017/12/ielts-writing-task-2-young-population-essay-plan.html">this lesson</a>. Today I'd like to show you two different ways to write the same paragraph.</p>
<p><strong>1. Paragraph describing three separate disadvantages:</strong></p>
<p>On the one hand, countries with a large proportion of young adults may experience <span style="text-decoration: underline;">various problems</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Firstly</span>, if considerable numbers of people leave school or university at the same time, there will be intense competition for jobs. This oversupply of labour could cause an increase in unemployment. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Secondly</span>, an abundance of working-age adults may result in higher rates of poverty and falling living standards, as governments or local councils are unable to meet the demand for the provision of housing and public services. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Finally</span>, there is a risk that rates of crime and antisocial behaviour may rise if the needs of a young population are not met.</p>
<p><strong>2. Paragraph focusing on one main disadvantage, with supporting ideas:</strong></p>
<p>On the one hand, countries with a large proportion of young adults may experience <span style="text-decoration: underline;">problems related to employment</span>. If considerable numbers of people leave school or university at the same time, there will be intense competition for jobs. This oversupply of labour could cause an increase in unemployment, or lead to poorer working conditions as employers realise that they can bring wages down and exploit young workers. Another possible consequence might be that young adults are forced to migrate abroad in search of work. An exodus of well-qualified young graduates and workers is often referred to as a ‘brain drain’, and this is not a desirable outcome for any country.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em><br>In the first paragraph, I simply describe three separate disadvantages using "firstly, secondly, finally". In the second paragraph, I go into more detail about the consequences in one area only (employment problems). Both paragraph types can be equally good - it just depends on the ideas that you have.</p>

				<p>When learning something new, it's always best to start off slowly. If you want to master a skill, you need to learn the necessary techniques and practise them slowly before you can gradually build up speed.</p>
<p>This was the idea behind yesterday's lesson. Start by practising 10-minute plans for speaking part 2, and gradually reduce your planning time. If you practise enough, you'll become much better at thinking of ideas for this part of the speaking test, and you'll be able to use your minute more effectively on the day of your test.</p>
<p><em><strong>Tip:</strong></em> think about other parts of the IELTS test that you could practise slowly.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here's an introduction and conclusion for the <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2017/12/ielts-writing-task-2-young-population-essay-plan.html">young population</a> question that we've been looking at. Can you find the examples of paraphrasing that I've used?</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong><br>At the present time, the population of some countries includes a relatively large number of young adults, compared with the number of older people. Do the advantages of this situation outweigh the disadvantages?</p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>It is true that younger adults make up a significant proportion of the population of some nations. While there are certain drawbacks for countries with this kind of population structure, I believe that the individual, social and economic benefits far outweigh these drawbacks.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br>In conclusion, it seems to me that it is advantageous in a variety of ways for countries to have more young adults than elderly people.</p>

	<p>
				<p>In the comments below Thursday's <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2017/12/ielts-writing-task-1-using-model-sentences.html">lesson</a>, I noticed a useful question from nav, and a very thoughtful response from Kati. It's great to see people discussing things and helping each other in the comments below my lessons!</p>
<p>To add to Kati's response, I'd like to say a little more about using 'model sentences'. First, I'll quickly repeat two useful points from Kati's comment:</p>
<ol>
<li>As Kati points out, the 'model sentences' exercise is probably more suited to writing task 1. This is because task 1 is quite predictable: we know that we'll have to describe trends, compare numbers or describe steps, so we can practise specific types of sentence for these purposes (e.g. 'while' sentences, 'respectively' sentences etc.).</li>
<li>There are some sentence types that I repeatedly use in writing task 2 (e.g. a 'while' sentence in the introduction). See Kati's comment for links to lessons about these sentence types.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now here's the final tip that I wanted to add:</p>
<p>Try not to confuse 'model' sentences with 'template' sentences. Examiners don't like essays that are full of memorised template language (read <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2017/09/ielts-advice-warning-about-templates.html">this warning</a>).</p>
<p>On the other hand, <em><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">any</span> correct sentence can be used as a model</strong></em>. For example, we could take the first sentence of today's lesson ("In the comments below Thursday's lesson, I noticed a useful question.") and invent a new sentence that follows a similar structure or pattern (e.g. On the way home from yesterday's lecture, I read an interesting article in the paper.).</p>
<p>I think you could turn this into a great daily exercise. But the aim would be to improve your English, not to collect template sentences for IELTS.</p>

				<p><strong><em>At the present time, the population of some countries includes a relatively large number of young adults, compared with the number of older people. Do the advantages of this situation outweigh the disadvantages?</em></strong></p>
<p>Using the ideas that people shared below last week's lesson, here's a simple essay plan:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Introduction:</strong> Introduce the topic, then say that there are more advantages than disadvantages.</li>
<li><strong>Paragraph about disadvantages:</strong> competition for jobs, oversupply of labour, possible increase in unemployment, pressure on housing and public services, social problems e.g. crime.</li>
<li><strong>Paragraph about advantages:</strong> young, vibrant workforce, new ideas, creativity, adopting new technologies, increased productivity, boost to economy, more money from taxes.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> repeat / summarise.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'll use these ideas to start writing the essay next Wednesday.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Some students have the mistaken idea that examiners compare candidates, and that you'll therefore get a lower score if you use words or phrases that "too many other candidates use".</p>
<p><strong>This is not true!</strong></p>
<p>Examiners are trained to mark candidates according to a defined set of criteria. For example, look at these phrases from the band descriptors for band 7 in writing task 2:</p>
<p>- addresses all parts of the task<br>- presents a clear position throughout the response<br>- logically organises information and ideas<br>- there is clear progression<br>- uses a sufficient range of vocabulary to allow some flexibility</p>
<p>You <em><strong>won't</strong> </em>find phrases like this in the band descriptors:</p>
<p>- too many candidates use ..... in their essays<br>- reduce the score if the word ..... is used</p>
<p>Remember: the only comparison that examiners make is between your answer and the band descriptors.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Source: Cambridge IELTS 12)</span></p>
<p>Here's how I would approach this type of question:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Planning:</strong> Brainstorm advantages and disadvantages of a young population.</li>
<li><strong>My view:</strong> Looking at the plan, it should be clear whether I have more (or stronger) advantages or disadvantages. Make a decision about what my view is.</li>
<li><strong>Introduction:</strong> Write 2 sentences - introduce the topic and my view.</li>
<li><strong>Paragraph 2:</strong> Present the weaker side of the argument.</li>
<li><strong>Paragraph 3:</strong> Present the stronger side (i.e. the side that 'outweighs' the other view).</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Repeat and summarise my view.</li>
</ol>
<p>Can you help me to plan some ideas? What are the advantages and disadvantages for countries with a large proportion of young adults?</p>

	<p>
				<p>Old exam questions are not reused in the writing test. However, there are some common <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2016/05/ielts-vocabulary-topic-list.html">topics</a> that come up again and again. Look at the two questions below, for example:</p>
<p><em style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;"><strong>1) In the developed world, average life expectancy is increasing. What problems will this cause for individuals and society? Suggest some measures that could be taken to reduce the impact of ageing populations.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>2) At the present time, the population of some countries includes a relatively large number of young adults, compared with the number of older people. Do the advantages of this situation outweigh the disadvantages?</strong></em></p>
<p>Can you see how the IELTS writers are looking at basically the same topic here, but from a different angle*?</p>
<p>- Number 1 is a 'problem and solution' question about ageing populations.<br>- Number 2 is a 'discussion and opinion'** question about younger populations.</p>
<p>You can see my essay for question 1 <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2013/01/ielts-writing-task-2-problemsolution-essay.html">here</a>. Question 2 comes from Cambridge IELTS book 12, and we'll look at this question over the next few weeks.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*from a different angle = from a different perspective / position</span><br><span style="font-size: 8pt;">**Write about both sides, but make it clear which side you think 'outweighs' the other</span></p>

	<p>
				<p>Here's a piece of advice that I gave in a blog lesson a few years ago. I forgot that I had written this, and I think it's worth repeating:</p>
<p><em>In my experience, people become good at what they focus on. Are you constantly reading things in English, thinking about English, watching English videos, and making notes of anything new that you learn? If English is your main focus each day, I'm sure you'll improve.</em></p>

	<p>
				<p>Before you retake the exam, ask yourself some questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What specific areas have I worked to improve since my last exam?</li>
<li>How do I know that I have improved?</li>
<li>Can I get higher scores when I'm practising than the scores I need?</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's an example of an ideal response to these questions:</p>
<p><em>Since my last exam, I've been doing a lot of work to improve my 'main body' paragraphs for writing task 2. I now spend more time planning and organising my ideas before I start writing, so my paragraphs are a lot better. My teacher noticed this improvement and gave my most recent essay a band 7. I only need a 6.5.</em></p>

	<p>
				<p>Over the years I've realised that one of the most important tips that I can give my students is this:</p>
<p><em><strong>Choose one method for writing essays and use this method every time you practise or take the test.</strong></em></p>
<p>Imagine a tennis player who decides to change her / his serving action, or a guitarist who experiments with a new way of holding the instrument, or an artist who decides to paint in a new style. In each case, the person's performance will probably get worse before it gets better.</p>
<p>But this is what I see happening with many IELTS students. Some of them keep trying new ways of writing, while others haven't thought about having a 'method' at all - they write each essay in a different way without realising it. Consequently, their scores either fluctuate or stay the same.</p>
<p><em><strong>The only way to hone* your writing skill is to choose a method or way of writing and then practise it as much as possible.</strong></em></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*hone = to perfect, refine, improve, sharpen</span></p>

				<p>Here's my full sample essay for the recycling topic that we've been working on.</p>
<p><em style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;"><strong>Some people claim that not enough of the waste from homes is recycled.

<p><em style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">It is true that we do not recycle enough of our household waste. Although I accept that new legislation to force people to recycle could help this situation, I do not agree that a recycling law is the only measure that governments should take.</span></strong></em></p>
<p><em style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">In my view, a new recycling law would be just one possible way to tackle the waste problem. Governments could make it a legal obligation for householders to separate all waste into different bins. There could be punishments for people who fail to adhere to this law, ranging from a small fine to community service, or even perhaps prison sentences for repeat offenders. These measures would act as a deterrent and encourage people to obey the recycling law. As a result, the improved behaviour of homeowners could lead to a clean, waste-free environment for everyone.</span></strong></em></p>
<p><em style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">However, I believe that governments should do more than simply introduce a recycling law. It might be more effective if politicians put education, rather than punishment, at the centre of a recycling campaign. For example, children could be taught about recycling in schools, and homeowners could be informed about the environmental impact of household waste. Another tactic that governments could use would be to create stricter regulations for the companies that produce the packaging for household products. Finally, money could also be spent to improve recycling facilities and systems, so that waste is processed more effectively, regardless of whether or not people separate it correctly in the home.</span></strong></em></p>
<p><em style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;"><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">In conclusion, perhaps we do need to make recycling a legal requirement, but this would certainly not be the only way to encourage people to dispose of their waste more responsibly.<br></span></strong></em></p>

	<p>
				<p>In last Saturday's <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2017/11/ielts-advice-the-power-of-repetition.html">lesson</a> I asked you to think about the power of repetition in terms of developing your English skills. Here are a few ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Listening:</strong> Listen to the same recording several times, but focus on something different each time you listen. I explained this idea <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2017/10/ielts-listening-listen-again-and-again.html">here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Speaking:</strong> Compile a list of questions, and practise answering them every day. Record yourself so that you can listen for mistakes, and make notes about how you could improve. The aim is to 'master' your list of questions before you move on to anything new.</li>
<li><strong>Reading:</strong> If you've done all of the tests in the official Cambridge IELTS books, do them all again, and again! It doesn't matter if you remember some of the answers; you'll still learn something new each time you do the tests. If you can 'master' every reading test in the Cambridge books, I guarantee you'll get a high score in the test (but you'll only master them if you repeat each test several times).</li>
<li><strong>Writing:</strong> Instead of writing four different essays (which will probably all get the same score), try rewriting the same essay four times. Each time you rewrite the essay, try to improve one aspect of it. For example, for the first rewrite you could work on grammar, then the second time you could try to add more detailed explanation, then for the third rewrite you could improve the vocabulary or the coherence.</li>
</ul>
<p>Repetitive exercises might seem like boring hard work, but I believe that you can use them as a form of 'training' to develop both your English skills and your exam skills.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Following on from the paragraph about a recycling law in last week's <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2017/11/ielts-writing-task-2-easy-opinion-not-real-opinion.html">lesson</a>, we need to write a paragraph about other measures that governments could take to encourage recycling.</p>
<p><strong>Here's my plan for a 5-sentence paragraph:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Topic sentence:</strong> other measures, instead of a recycling law</li>
<li><strong>First idea:</strong> educate people with a recycling campaign</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> teach children in schools, inform homeowners too</li>
<li><strong>Second idea:</strong> regulations for companies that produce packaging</li>
<li><strong>Third idea:</strong> invest in recycling facilities to process waste better</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Here's a paragraph using the ideas above:</strong></p>
<p>However, I believe that governments should do more than simply introduce a recycling law. It would be far more effective if politicians put education, rather than punishment, at the centre of a recycling campaign. For example, children could be taught about recycling in schools, and homeowners could be informed about the environmental impact of household waste. Another tactic that governments could use would be to create stricter regulations for the companies that produce the packaging for household products. Finally, money could also be spent to improve recycling facilities and systems, so that waste could be processed more effectively, regardless of whether people had separated it correctly in the home.</p>

	<p>
				<p>In Thursday's <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2017/11/ielts-writing-task-1-overview-highest-and-lowest.html">lesson</a> about IELTS writing task 1, I wrote that it's ok to describe the highest and lowest figures in your 'overview' paragraph. However, thanks to a comment by Erika, I've realised that I should add some extra advice or some warnings about this:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, it's important to remember that the best type of overview is one that describes overall trends, rather than specific details. The highest and lowest figures on a chart are normally considered to be specific details, so they shouldn't be your first choice for the overview.</li>
<li>If you can't see a clear general trend, it's ok to describe the highest and lowest, but don't mention any numbers.</li>
<li>Look for the highest and lowest category overall, rather than a single highest or lowest point. For example, if you're writing an overview about a line graph, it's fine to say that one of the lines was highest for most of the period, but don't describe any specific peaks (save them for the 'details' paragraphs).</li>
</ul>
<p>The overview that I wrote on Thursday was fine because the main aim of the chart was not to show trends. Picking out the most and least environmentally friendly country made sense in this particular case, and I didn't mention specific numbers.</p>
<p>However, I want to make it clear that <em><strong>describing the highest and lowest should not be your first choice method for writing the overview</strong></em>. Look for overall trends first.</p>
<p><strong>Task:</strong><br>Next Thursday I'll show you an alternative overview paragraph for the "waste chart" question. Can you suggest which "main or general points" about the chart I could include, instead of describing the highest and lowest?</p>

	<p>
				<p>I've been thinking about the power of repetition (in the sense of practising the same thing many times) this week.</p>
<p>Young children (the best language learners!) love watching the same cartoon or reading the same book again and again. But as adult language learners we rarely do this; we move on to the next thing too quickly.</p>
<p>Let's think about how we can build some repetition into our IELTS practice. I gave you some ideas yesterday and on Tuesday, but what else can we do? Feel free to share your thoughts in the comments below, and I'll give you my tips next weekend.</p>

	<p>
				<p>You don't need to give your <strong><em>real</em></strong> opinion in your task 2 essays. Just choose an opinion that is <strong><em>easy</em></strong> to explain and support. For example, read the paragraph below.</p>
<p>..........</p>
<p>In my view, a new recycling law would be just one possible way to tackle the waste problem. Governments could make it a legal obligation for householders to separate all waste into different bins. There could be punishments for people who fail to adhere to this law, ranging from a small fine to community service, <em><strong>or even perhaps prison sentences for repeat offenders</strong></em>. These measures would act as a deterrent and encourage people to obey the recycling law. As a result, the improved behaviour of homeowners could lead to a clean, waste-free environment for everyone.</p>
<p>..........</p>
<p>Look at the phrase that I've highlighted in bold italic letters. Do I really believe that people should be sent to prison for failing to separate household waste properly?</p>
<p>The answer is no. I simply chose an easy opinion, and I explained it in a logical way, building an argument that, I admit, becomes a little extreme! But the examiner will not judge my opinions as extreme; he or she will only judge the coherence of the paragraph and the language used. The 'prison sentence' idea will not bring my score down. In fact, it will probably help my score because I've expressed the idea using some nice vocabulary.</p>

<p><em><strong>Some people claim that not enough of the waste from homes is recycled.

<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>It is true that we do not recycle enough of our household waste. Although I accept that new legislation to force people to recycle could help this situation, I do not agree that a recycling law is the only measure that governments should take.</p>
<p><strong>Topic sentence for first main paragraph</strong><br>In my view, a new recycling law would be just one possible way to tackle the waste problem.</p>
<p><strong>Topic sentence for second main paragraph</strong><br>However, I believe that governments should do more than simply introduce a recycling law.</p>

<ul>
<li>4 sentences: topic sentence then 3 advantages</li>
<li>Organising: I think... / First,... / Another benefit would be... / Finally, it seems to me that...</li>
<li>Good vocabulary: clear advantages, lack of traffic or industry, the average city, sense of community, everyone knows each other, the pace of life, laid back, the hustle and bustle</li>
<li>Interesting grammar: second sentence begins with a subordinate clause using 'with'</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Answer 3</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>3 sentences: direct answer, explanation, the opposite or alternative</li>
<li>Organising: Yes, think... / A visit can be both... and... / If schools don't offer...</li>
<li>Good vocabulary: both relaxing and educational, walks in the fresh air, may never have seen before, offer this opportunity, life outside the city</li>
<li>Interesting grammar: adding information using 'especially', use of semicolon to expand on one idea, first conditional sentence to imagine the alternative</li>

	<p>
				<p>Here's another band 9 sample answer.</p>
<p><em><strong>In many cities the use of video cameras in public places is being increased in order to reduce crime, but some people believe that these measures restrict our individual freedom.</strong></em><br><em><strong>Do the benefits of increased security outweigh the drawbacks?</strong></em></p>
<p>It is true that video surveillance has become commonplace in many cities in recent years. While I understand that critics may see this as an invasion of privacy, I believe that the benefits do outweigh the drawbacks.</p>
<p>There are two main reasons why people might disapprove of the use of video cameras in public places. The first objection is that these cameras invade our privacy, in the sense that we are constantly being watched by the authorities or by private security firms. Many people find this intrusive and feel that the recording of their movements is a form of state control that curtails their individual freedom. The second argument against the proliferation of CCTV cameras is that they are being used as an alternative to police officers patrolling the streets. If this is indeed happening, then it is unlikely that members of the public will feel safer.</p>
<p>In spite of the drawbacks mentioned above, I believe that the use of video cameras to monitor public areas is a positive measure. The key objective of video surveillance is to deter criminals and to prevent crime. For example, petty criminals like shoplifters and pickpockets are less likely to operate in parts of cities where they know that they are being watched. At the same time, when crimes are committed, the police can use video evidence to catch and prosecute offenders. Therefore, in my view, video cameras offer valuable support to police officers, and they make cities safer for inhabitants, workers and visitors alike.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it seems to me that we gain more than we lose from the enhanced security that CCTV cameras bring to our cities.</p>

	<p>
				<p>If you've read enough of my blog lessons, you'll know that I often include three ideas in my main body paragraphs (e.g. firstly, secondly, finally). But what if you only have two ideas? Let's have a look at a "two-idea" paragraph today.</p>
<p>Here's my plan for a 5-sentence paragraph about the negatives of CCTV:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Topic sentence:</strong> there are two main arguments against CCTV</li>
<li><strong>The first negative:</strong> video cameras in public invade our privacy</li>
<li><strong>Explain more:</strong> intrusive, feels like state control, curtails our freedom</li>
<li><strong>The second negative:</strong> cameras instead of police officers</li>
<li><strong>Explain more:</strong> if cameras replace police, we will not feel safer</li>
</ol>
<p>And here's my 5-sentence paragraph using the ideas above:</p>
<p>There are two main reasons why people might disapprove of the use of video cameras in public places. The first objection is that these cameras invade our privacy, in the sense that we are constantly being watched by the authorities or by private security firms. Many people find this intrusive and feel that the recording of their movements is a form of state control that curtails their individual freedom.

				<p>A fast way to test someone's ability to speak a language is to ask them to paraphrase something - to express the same idea in a variety of ways.

	<p>
				<p>From the comments that people wrote below Wednesday's <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2017/09/ielts-writing-task-2-template-language.html">lesson</a>, it seems that many students find essay templates useful. However, I think it's important to repeat the warning that I gave in my own comment below that lesson.</p>
<p><strong>Warning about templates:</strong></p>
<p>Templates can certainly be useful, as they can help us to quickly organise our ideas. Also, it is inevitable that we will need to use some 'linking' words and phrases in our essays.</p>
<p>However, there is also a danger that people focus more on the template than on answering the question with good ideas. Templates and linking are <em><strong>not</strong></em> the secret to a high score in the writing test. They just do a simple job - they help you to organise your ideas, that's all. In the end, your score will depend on the quality of language that you use to <em><strong>express ideas</strong></em>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> simply to <em><strong>organise</strong></em> them.</p>
<p>So, learn some basic template / linking / organising language, but don't become obsessed with it. Spend most of your time working on topic vocabulary and your ability to express and develop "real" ideas.</p>

				<p>Let's compare the 'template' language that I used to organise the ideas in my two most recent essays.</p>
<p><strong>Essay 1</strong><br>In last week's <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2017/08/ielts-writing-task-2-permissive-parenting-answer.html">permissive parenting</a> essay, I didn't use much template language at all. Here are the linking / organising phrases from that essay. I don't think we can really call this a 'template'.</p>
<p>..........</p>
<p><em>It is true that</em><br><em>In my opinion,</em></p>
<p><em>I believe that</em><br><em>Having + past participle (personal example)</em><br><em>In my view,</em></p>
<p><em>The first and most obvious</em><br><em>One consequence of</em><br><em>A second negative</em><br><em>This may lead, for example, to</em></p>
<p><em>In conclusion, … should …, and I do not believe that…</em></p>
<p>..........</p>
<p><strong>Essay 2</strong><br>Now look at the <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2017/06/ielts-writing-task-2-homework-essay.html">homework</a> essay that I wrote back in June. In that essay I used a more typical 'template' structure.</p>
<p>..........</p>
<p><em>People’s opinions differ as to whether or not</em><br><em>While there are some strong arguments against….., I still believe that</em></p>
<p><em>There are several reasons why people might argue that</em><br><em>Firstly,</em><br><em>Secondly,</em><br><em>Finally,</em></p>
<p><em>In spite of the above arguments, I support the view that</em><br><em>The main benefit of</em><br><em>For example,</em><br><em>In my view,</em></p>
<p><em>In conclusion, ….. certainly has its drawbacks, but I believe that the benefits outweigh them in the long term.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Having worked</strong> with children myself, I have learnt that clear expectations and boundaries are necessary.</em></p>
<p>Try creating your own personal examples with "having + past participle". You can also add the word "never" to make a negative. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Having lived</strong></em> abroad myself, I understand how important it is to learn about local customs.</li>
<li><em><strong>Having never tracked</strong></em> my fitness goals before, I found the new app really useful.</li>

	<p>
				<p>Here's my full answer to the question below.</p>
<p><strong><em>Some parents&nbsp;buy their children whatever they ask for, and allow their children to do whatever they want. Is this a good way to raise children? What consequences could this style of parenting have for children as they get older?</em></strong></p>
<p>It is true that some parents are overly permissive and tend to spoil their children. In my opinion, this is not a good parenting style, and it can have a range of negative long-term consequences.</p>
<p>If parents want to raise respectful and well-behaved children, I believe that a certain amount of discipline is necessary. Having worked with children myself, I have learnt that clear expectations and boundaries are necessary, and it is important to be able to say ‘no’ to children when they misbehave or try to push against these boundaries. This is the only way to help young people to regulate their desires and develop self-control. In my view, parents who do the opposite and constantly give in to their children’s demands, are actually doing more harm than good. They are failing their children rather than being kind to them.</p>
<p>The children of indulgent or lenient parents are likely to grow up with several negative personality traits. The first and most obvious danger is that these children will become self-centred adults who show little consideration for the feelings or needs of others. One consequence of such an attitude could be that these adults are unable to work successfully in teams with other colleagues. A second negative trait in such people could be impulsiveness. A person who has never lived with any boundaries is likely to lack the patience to carefully consider options before making decisions. This may lead, for example, to compulsive shopping, unwise financial decisions, or even criminal activity.</p>
<p>In conclusion, parents should help their children to develop self-control and respect for others, and I do not believe that the permissive parenting style supports this objective.</p>

	<h4><a href="https://www.ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2017/08/ielts-advice-you-dont-need-a-grammar-book.html">IELTS Advice: you don't need a grammar book</a></h4>
	<p>
				<p>Yesterday a student asked me to recommend a good grammar book. My answer to this question is that <em><strong>you don't need one</strong></em>. Let me explain my reasons for this view.</p>
<p>When I was at school, language learning meant studying two things: 1) grammar rules and 2) lists of vocabulary. The idea was that we should use the grammar rules to construct sentences, and the vocabulary would fill in the gaps. To me this seemed like a "mathematical" approach, where each grammar rule is like a formula. If you use a grammar book, you're probably following this method.</p>
<p>Nowadays I prefer a different approach, especially when teaching IELTS. Here are <strong><em>five reasons</em></strong> why I've moved away from the "grammar book" method:</p>
<ol>
<li>I believe that students can pass the test more quickly if they remember that grammar only accounts for 25% of their score, and they focus instead on the other <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2017/03/ielts-advice-the-other-75.html">75%</a>.</li>
<li>I believe that the "mathematical formula" approach causes people to create unnatural sentences.</li>
<li>I think that a better use of your time is to read and listen to as much native-speaker English as possible, so that you pick up the words, phrases and constructions that English speakers really use.</li>
<li>If you want to improve your grammar for IELTS, I recommend that you ask a teacher to highlight your mistakes. Instead of learning rules from a book, just aim to learn from the mistakes that you make, and therefore gradually "edit" your English.</li>
<li>You can check any grammar point with a quick search on the Internet. There's no need to slowly work through a book any more!</li>

	<p>
				<p>On Wednesday I wrote about 'template language', and there's a useful comment from sjm (another IELTS teacher) below the lesson. Here's what he said:</p>
<p><em>The problem with a lot of templates is that they contain too many memorised words and phrases. This then lowers the amount of topic vocabulary. Simon even uses a basic template (for example, he uses a five sentence body paragraph with a clear topic sentence, and similar linkers). However the key is that a template (or what I would call 'good organisation') does not dominate the essay. I always say from an examiner's point of view that candidates should keep memorised words and linkers to under 20% of the total word count.</em></p>
<p><strong>This made me think:</strong> Which words or phrases in some of my own essays could we highlight as 'template language' or 'good organisation'?</p>
<p>If you have time, make a list of the template / organising language in the two essays linked below. We can then compare the two lists.</p>

	<h4><a href="https://www.ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2017/08/ielts-writing-task-2-question-about-templates.html">IELTS Writing Task 2: templates and 'firstly, secondly, finally'</a></h4>
	<p>
				<p>Here's a question that someone asked me yesterday (I've rewritten it in my own words to make it shorter):</p>
<p><em>I've heard that examiners in China are lowering scores when candidates use prepared writing templates. The linking words "firstly, secondly, finally" are considered as 'template words' for writing task 2, so how can we replace them to avoid getting a lower score?</em></p>
<p>First, there are a couple of problems with this question:</p>
<ul>
<li>It assumes that examiners in one country have decided to create their own rules about how tests should be marked. This is not true! All examiners are trained to use the band descriptors in the same way.</li>
<li>It implies that the use of just three simple words (firstly, secondly, finally) will automatically bring your score down. This is also wrong! Your score will not be lowered on the basis of just three words.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, let's look at what the band descriptors say about this issue:</p>
<ul>
<li>The band descriptors refer to "over-use of cohesive devices" at band 5 level. In other words, if you use too many linking words or template phrases, you're in danger of entering band 5 territory for "coherence and cohesion", which is worth 25% of your score.</li>
<li>On the other hand, if we look at the descriptor for band 7, we can see the phrase "uses a range of cohesive devices appropriately". This tells us that we do need to use some linking words, but only where they help the flow of ideas.</li>
<li>No specific examples of good or bad linking or 'template' words are given in the band descriptors, so there is nothing inherently wrong with using "firstly, secondly, finally". Personally I dislike the word <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2015/04/ielts-writing-task-2-moreover-isnt-a-difficult-word.html">'moreover'</a>, but I've never lowered a candidate's score just because he/she used this word once or twice.</li>
</ul>
<p>To sum up, here's a more direct answer to the student's question:</p>
<p>Examiners in every country (not only in China) want to read essays that are full of <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2012/01/ielts-advice-real-content.html">'real content'</a>; they don't like essays that mainly consist of <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2016/10/ielts-advice-phrases-for-any-essay.html">'phrases for any essay'</a>. I think it's true that too many candidates rely on templates, and I believe that people should focus on preparing topic ideas instead.</p>
<p>Having said that, you <em><strong>do</strong></em> need to link and organise your ideas, and simple words like "firstly, secondly, finally" can help you to do that. These words will only have a negative effect on your score if you overuse them, or if you use them wrongly. But if you still want to avoid using "firstly, secondly, finally", there are plenty of other ways to organise your ideas (<a href="http://ielts-simon.com/files/alternatives-for-firstly.pdf">click here</a> and <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2012/03/ielts-writing-task-2-firstly-secondly-finally.html">here</a> to see some examples).</p>

				<p>A full day of testing isn't easy, and you'll probably get a shock on your exam day if you've only practised individual parts of the test at home.</p>
<p>So, as part of your IELTS preparation, why not do a full day of testing at home, maybe once every two weeks? In the morning, start with a full listening test, then go straight on to a reading test, and follow that with both writing tasks. Have lunch, and then ask a friend or family member to be your speaking examiner in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Don't worry too much about your scores. Just get used to the difficulty of maintaining concentration for a full day. You'll be much better prepared when your exam day arrives if you've done a few of these mock test days at home.</p>

	<p>
				<p>If a teacher, website, book or friend tells you that you <em><strong>must</strong></em> do a particular thing in the writing test, you can check the band descriptors to see whether it's true.</p>
<p>For example, I often receive questions like this:</p>
<p>My teacher told me that I <em><strong>must</strong></em> add a second sentence, containing a recommendation or prediction, to my task 2 conclusions? Is this true?</p>
<p>Here's my answer:</p>
<p>No, this is not true. There's nothing in the band descriptors about conclusions needing a recommendation or prediction. I think it's fine for teachers to say "this is how I think we should write a good conclusion", but they should make it clear that they are giving <em><strong>advice</strong></em> rather than stating a rule. <em><strong>If it's not in the band descriptors, it's not a rule</strong></em>.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Thanks to those of you who wished me a happy holiday! I'm feeling refreshed after a week off, and I thought it would be a good time to share a positive message that I received from a student, called Evan, who passed the IELTS test this month.</p>
<p>Here are the main parts of Evan's message:</p>
<p><em>Dear Simon,</em></p>
<p><em>I received my IELTS result this morning, and I am so happy to share with you that I've achieved my goal (7.0 for every part). I started taking IELTS in October 2016, and this is my 5th attempt. I would like to thank you very much for your useful lessons, tips and advice on your blog and your video course. I could not have got the results without it. I also want to share with you my experience, and hopefully this could once again prove that if one follows your method, he or she will succeed one day.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>My journey to achieving my IELTS goal has been very difficult and frustrating as I have been stuck with either writing or reading, especially writing. At some points I almost gave up and was thinking that IELTS may not be for me.&nbsp;But when I felt down, I read your posts and comments from successful takers, especially James Z, Chanaka and Kevin, which inspired me to continue. After my 4th attempt, I decided to take time off work so I could devote all my time to study. I studied from 9am to 6.30pm from Monday to Saturday for 5 weeks, and I wrote 34 essays and 11 letters following your method, and had 6 essays and 2 letters corrected. This helped identify my common mistakes, such as grammar error and word choice, and also to give me an idea of what a band 7.0 in writing would look like. I focused on learning topic vocabulary, and I practised the keyword technique for writing and listening. I strictly followed your advice for speaking part 1 (short and easy), part 2 (vocabulary theme) and part 3 (flow).</em></p>
<p><em>After all, I think that the key to IELTS band 7 includes the following:</em></p>
<ol>
<li><em>Hard work always pays off.</em></li>
<li><em>Trust ielts-simon.com's lessons, you don't need any others, even books. In fact, I only used the 12 Cambridge books and Official Practice Materials from ielts.org.</em></li>
<li><em>Don't waste time and money to take the test repeatedly. Instead, concentrate on language learning, and take the test when you are ready.</em></li>
<li><em>Spend more time on studying and practising than testing (I found this advice from you the most useful).</em></li>
<li><em>Have someone to check your work to identify common mistakes.</em></li>
</ol>
<p><em>Once again, thank you Simon very much and I really appreciate your work. Now,I can go back to work while preparing for the next chapter of my life with my IELTS result.</em></p>
<p><em>Regards,</em><br><em>Evan</em></p>

				<p>A student pointed out that I often use the word 'get' in my sample answers for IELTS speaking. For example, I wrote "get cash out" in my answer to question 4 in yesterday's lesson.</p>
<p>So, is it acceptable to use the word 'get' or is it too informal? Here's my answer:</p>
<p>The word 'get' is used so often in spoken English that no native speaker (or examiner) will even notice that you've used it. In fact, it might even help to make your speech sound more fluent and natural if you use 'get' in your speaking test.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> 'get' is fine in the speaking test, but I would normally avoid using it in the writing test.</span></p>

	<p>
				<p>Many people who need band 7 seem to get stuck at band 6.5, especially in the writing test. I've written about this <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2014/02/ielts-advice-from-65-to-7.html">here</a> and <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2013/07/ielts-advice-for-people-with-65.html">here</a>, but a student asked me to give a bit more advice about how to move from 6.5 to 7.</p>
<p>As I said in the lessons linked above, band 6.5 in writing is very close to band 7, so you only need to make a small improvement in the quality of your essays.</p>
<p><em><strong>But where will this small improvement come from?</strong></em> Here are some tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, if you want to make this small improvement quickly, I don't recommend that you focus on grammar. Improving your grammatical accuracy is probably going to be a slow and gradual process.</li>
<li>So that leaves us with 3 possible areas for improvement: task response, coherence and cohesion, and vocabulary.</li>
<li>In my experience, <strong><em>the secret to improving in all three areas is planning</em></strong>. A good plan will ensure that you answer the question, and that your answer is coherent and well structured. Hopefully it will also contain some good ideas (i.e. vocabulary).</li>
</ul>
<p>Look at the essay plan in <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2017/06/ielts-writing-task-2-homework-essay-plan.html">this lesson</a> and the resulting essay that I wrote <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2017/06/ielts-writing-task-2-homework-essay.html">here</a>. Without a good plan, I find it very difficult to "improvise" a coherent essay, so I'm sure that you do too. Give yourself more planning time (around <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2012/08/ielts-writing-task-2-how-to-use-your-40-minutes.html">10 minutes</a>), and you'll write better essays.</p>
<p><strong>A couple of notes about the advice above</strong><strong>:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Maybe you have read my lessons about 10-minute plans and 13-sentence essays, but are you <em><strong>really</strong></em> following this advice? I've taught many students who used my methods well in lessons and homework tasks, but "crumbled" under the pressure of a real exam and went back to their "old ways". Is this happening to you?</li>
<li>If you <strong><em>are</em></strong> following all of my advice about planning and writing 13-sentence essays, maybe your problem is writing task 1, not task 2.</li>

	<p>
				<p>Here's my full essay for the question below.</p>
<p><em><strong>Some people believe that school children should not be given homework by their teachers, whereas others argue that homework plays an important role in the education of children. Discuss both of these views and give your own opinion.</strong></em></p>
<p>People’s opinions differ as to whether or not school children should be given homework. While there are some strong arguments against the setting of homework, I still believe that it is a necessary aspect of education.</p>
<p>There are several reasons why people might argue that homework is an unnecessary burden on children. Firstly, there is evidence to support the idea that homework does nothing to improve educational outcomes. Countries such as Finland, where school children are not given homework, regularly top international educational league tables and outperform nations where setting homework is the norm. Secondly, many parents would agree that the school day is already long enough, and leaves their children too tired to do further study when they return home. Finally, it is recognised that play time is just as beneficial as study time from the perspective of brain development.</p>
<p>In spite of the above arguments, I support the view that homework has an important role to play in the schooling of children. The main benefit of homework is that it encourages independent learning and problem solving, as children are challenged to work through tasks alone and at their own pace. In doing so, students must apply the knowledge that they have learnt in the classroom. For example, by doing mathematics exercises at home, students consolidate their understanding of the concepts taught by their teacher at school. In my view, it is important for children to develop an independent study habit because this prepares them to work alone as adults.</p>
<p>In conclusion, homework certainly has its drawbacks, but I believe that the benefits outweigh them in the long term.</p>

	<p>
				<p><strong>Studying alone</strong></p>
<p>It's certainly possible to prepare for the IELTS test alone. Every week I receive messages from people who tell me that they passed the test without attending any "normal" lessons. Some of them used only the free lessons here on the blog, while others found my video course to be exactly what they needed.</p>
<p><strong>Taking lessons</strong></p>
<p>On the other hand, not everyone likes working independently. You might find that attending English lessons with a teacher suits you better. The good news is that your teacher <em><strong>doesn't need to be an IELTS expert</strong></em>. You already have all the IELTS advice that you need here, so just try to find a good "general English" teacher.</p>
<p><strong>A middle point</strong></p>
<p>A "middle point" between the two paths above could be to study alone but get some feedback from an IELTS teacher every now and then. For example, you could study my blog lessons, and then <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2016/10/essay-correction-and-speaking-practice.html">get an essay checked</a> or try taking a realistic <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2016/10/essay-correction-and-speaking-practice.html">online speaking test</a> with one of my colleagues. If you're working alone, a teacher's feedback will make sure you're on the right track.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Instead of always writing full essays, it's a good idea to practise single paragraphs. Start with ideas (a 5-point plan), then write a sentence for each idea. If you make sure the sentences "flow" properly and work well together, you'll be able to create a good paragraph.</p>

<p><strong>Planned ideas (arguments against homework)</strong><br>1. Topic (e.g. People disagree with homework for several reasons)<br>2. Firstly: homework does not improve educational outcomes<br>3.

				<p><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(mindset = established set of attitudes or way of thinking)</span></p>
<p>It seems to me that too many students have a <em><strong>"grammar mindset"</strong></em>. They believe that 'complex structures' are the key to a high IELTS score, and they focus on learning grammar rules and linking phrases.</p>
<p>I prefer the<strong> <em>"vocabulary mindset"</em></strong>. Students who have this mindset are more concerned about how native speakers <span style="text-decoration: underline;">really</span> use the language. They 'collect' words, phrases and collocations by doing lots of reading and listening, and they enjoy using the new vocabulary that they have 'copied' from these sources.</p>

	<p>
				<p>In this lesson I'll try to answer Kami's question (see yesterday's lesson). Let's start by looking at the sentence below in more detail.</p>
<p><em>Fierce debates have been provoked if assignments ought to be done by students.</em></p>
<p><strong>Grammar</strong><br>There's really only one grammar mistake in the sentence above: the word "if" is used wrongly. We would need to write something like this: "Fierce debates have been provoked <strong><em>about the issue of whether</em></strong> assignments..."</p>
<p><strong>Vocabulary</strong><br>However, vocabulary is the real problem in the sentence:</p>
<ol>
<li>The word <strong><em>fierce</em></strong> is much too strong, and seems unnatural or inappropriate in this context. Are people really having fierce (i.e. furious, very angry) debates about homework?</li>
<li>I would also question the use of the word <strong><em>debates</em></strong>. Are people really debating this homework issue? Maybe they are, but this still seems a little exaggerated to me.</li>
<li>Next, while it isn't grammatically wrong, I would question the use of the word <em><strong>provoked</strong></em>. Has someone or something provoked this debate?</li>
<li>Finally, <em><strong>assignments</strong></em> are not necessarily the same thing as homework. Assignments can be done in the classroom, so the use of this word confuses the issue.</li>
</ol>
<p>While the grammar of the original sentence was <em>almost</em> correct, any native English speaker would find the sentence strange or unnatural, due to the vocabulary issues mentioned above. There's nothing "advanced or complex" about choosing inappropriate or exaggerated words that no English speaker would use.</p>
<p><strong>Final tip:</strong><br>It's good to be fascinated by new words and phrases, but using them correctly and appropriately is a different challenge. For most people, trying to write like an English-speaking journalist or novelist is like trying to play football at the level of Messi or Ronaldo! If you aim for such a high level, you're likely to make big mistakes.</p>

				<p>A student wrote to me recently to tell me about his negative experience of the test centre on the day of his IELTS exam. He said that the test centre staff were unfriendly and unhelpful, and he wondered whether it was a good idea to complain.</p>
<p>Let's consider some problems that you might experience on your test day:</p>
<ul>
<li>unfriendly staff</li>
<li>an unfriendly examiner</li>
<li>other candidates coughing or sneezing</li>
<li>unclear instructions from staff</li>
<li>noises outside the building</li>
<li>a wobbly table</li>
<li>any other problem with the exam environment that you can think of</li>
</ul>
<p>What should you do about these problems? Tell us what you would do in the 'comments' area below, and I'll give you my advice in tomorrow's lesson.</p>

				<p>Following the video that I shared in yesterday's lesson, here's a writing task 2 question on the same topic:</p>
<p><em><strong>Some people believe that school children should not be given homework by their teachers, whereas others argue that homework plays an important role in the education of children. Discuss both of these views and give your own opinion.</strong></em></p>

	<h4><a href="https://www.ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2017/05/ielts-grammar-vocabulary-fixed-phrases.html">IELTS Grammar / Vocabulary: 'fixed phrases'</a></h4>
	<p>
				<p>Sometimes it's better <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> to look at word usage from a grammar perspective. Instead, we can accept that some phrases are 'fixed', and there's no point worrying about the individual words within them.</p>
<p>The phrase <em><strong>"I look forward to seeing you"</strong></em>, from yesterday's lesson, is a good example. There's no point trying to understand why we use "to + ing" in this phrase. Just learn it as a fixed phrase.</p>
<p>Let's take another example. Someone asked me for a grammatical explanation of my use of the word "for" in the sentence below:</p>
<p><em>One option would be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">for</span> police officers to visit schools.</em> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(taken from <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2015/09/ielts-writing-task-2-strong-opinion-essay.html">this essay</a>)</span></p>
<p>Here's the answer that I gave the student:</p>
<p>It might be best to learn the whole phrase "one option would be for x to..." without trying to understand it word by word. You could consider this to be a 'fixed phrase'.</p>
<p>In other words, rather than looking at this from a grammar perspective, you could learn it as a vocabulary item. Then, the best way to understand the phrase is to see it used in various different contexts. Here are some examples from a Google search:</p>
<ul>
<li>One option would be for national authorities to intervene.</li>
<li>In order to improve the economy, one option would be for the government to invest in infrastructure.</li>
<li>One option would be for staff to work more hours.</li>
</ul>

	<p>
				<p>Many students have learnt that 'to' can't be followed by a word ending in 'ing'. But you might have noticed that I break this 'rule' in some of my essays. For example:</p>
<p>"strict punishments for driving offences are <strong>the key <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to</span> reduc<span style="text-decoration: underline;">ing</span></strong> traffic accidents"</p>
<p>This phrase is completely correct, so it must mean that the "rule" was wrong! You <span style="text-decoration: underline;">can</span> put 'to' with 'ing' in many situations. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>The key to being more productive is...</li>
<li>I look forward to seeing you.</li>
<li>He admitted to taking the money.</li>
<li>Scientists are closer to being able to...</li>
<li>Seven steps to reaching your goals!</li>

<p>Can you find any more examples?<br>Tip: try searching on Google for "to being", "to having", "to doing" etc.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Don't forget that a good English dictionary should be a key tool as you prepare for the IELTS test. Here's an example of how a dictionary can help you:</p>
<p>The other day I received a message from a student who asked why I wrote "the media <span style="text-decoration: underline;">are</span>" instead of "the media <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is</span>" in one of the sentences in my ebook.</p>
<p>Instead of trying to answer this question myself, I simply copied the relevant section from my computer's dictionary. Here's what it says:</p>
<p><strong>media</strong><br><em>usage: The word media comes from the Latin plural of medium. The traditional view is that it should therefore be treated as a plural noun in all its senses in English and be used with a plural rather than a singular verb: the media have not followed the reports (rather than ‘has’). In practice, in the sense ‘television, radio, and the press collectively’, it behaves as a collective noun (like staff or clergy, for example), which means that it is now acceptable in standard English for it to take either a singular or a plural verb.</em></p>

	<p>
				<p>Yesterday I showed you a 'bad' conclusion template, but what does a 'good' template look like?</p>
<p>One way for me to answer this is to recommend that you forget about templates completely. Just use the shortest, most basic 'organising' phrases, like "In conclusion", and focus on answering the question. In other words, you should worry about 'topic language', not 'template language'.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you really want a template for conclusions, have a look at <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2011/11/ielts-writing-task-2-conclusions.html">this lesson</a>. The templates you'll see there are acceptable.</p>

<p>My advice is simple: <strong>throw this template away!</strong> First, it contains mistakes. Second, it doesn't really make sense.

	<h4><a href="https://www.ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2017/04/ielts-advice-memorised-language.html">IELTS Advice: memorised language</a></h4>
	<p>
				<p>What do examiners consider to be "memorised language", and how will your score be affected if you use it?</p>
<p><strong>Words</strong><br>Individual words will not be considered memorised. However, if you have learnt some "big" words, you should make sure that you can use them in a natural and appropriate way, because incorrect use of words will affect your vocabulary score.</p>
<p><strong>Phrases</strong><br>It's fine to memorise and use "<a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2015/02/ielts-advice-collocations-and-topic-vocabulary.html">topic vocabulary</a>" phrases (e.g.&nbsp;<em>the opportunity to engage face-to-face</em>) and short organising phrases (e.g. <em>people have different views about</em>...). However, I recommend that you avoid learning <strong><em>long</em></strong> "<a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2016/10/ielts-advice-phrases-for-any-essay.html">any essay</a>" phrases (e.g. ... <em>is a controversial and hotly debated issue in today's world</em>). These "phrases for any essay" are very obvious to the examiner, and you'll probably get a lower score if you use them.</p>
<p><strong>Sentences</strong><br>Again, "topic vocabulary" is fine, but "any essay" sentences are not. So, if the question is about environmental problems, you can use a full sentence from my blog (e.g. <em>Human activity is a major factor in the rise of the greenhouse gases that cause global warming</em>). Having said that, it isn't easy to memorise full sentences for a wide range of topics, so I advise people to learn shorter "topic" phrases instead.</p>
<p><strong>Paragraphs and full essays</strong><br>If you write a perfect paragraph or full essay from memory and it fits the question, the examiner will not know and you will not be penalised. However, you would need to memorise hundreds of essays, so I don't recommend that you take this approach! Furthermore, if you write a perfect essay but it doesn't match the question, you will score zero!</p>
<p><strong>My final tip</strong><br>I recommend that you learn words and phrases (and maybe a few full sentences) for common IELTS topics, as well as some simple words and phrases for linking and organising your ideas. <strong><em>Don't</em></strong> learn lists of "phrases for any essay".</p>

	<p>
				<p>If you use words, phrases or sentences from this website or from my ebook, will the examiner know that you have copied me, and therefore consider part of your answer to be memorised?</p>
<p>The answer is <strong>no</strong>! You can, and you should, use the language that you find on this site. If you can't use the language that a teacher gives you, how are you expected to learn English?</p>
<p>For example, look at the following sentence from my most recent essay:</p>
<p><em>"Students may not have the opportunity to engage face-to-face with their teachers."</em></p>
<p>It would be fine to use a word (e.g. engage) or a phrase (e.g. the opportunity to engage face-to-face) from this sentence. You can even use the whole sentence, as long as it's relevant to the question that you have been asked.</p>
<p>So what do examiners consider to be "memorised language"? I'll explain that in tomorrow's lesson.</p>

				<p>Here's my analysis of the essay in last week's <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2017/03/ielts-writing-task-2-positive-or-negative-essay.html">lesson</a>:</p>
<p><strong>Task response</strong><br>If you look at the 'skeleton' of my essay (introduction, first sentence of each body paragraph, conclusion), you can see that I answer the question very clearly. Then, within the body paragraphs there are well-developed ideas to support my answer.</p>
<p><strong>Coherence and cohesion (i.e. organisation)</strong><br>I used my normal method: 4 paragraphs containing 13 sentences in total. The essay is easy to read because it is well organised and the ideas are developed in a very clear, logical way. Linking words (e.g. and, similarly, this, for example, mentioned above, firstly, secondly, finally, while, which) are used to connect ideas, but the <em>linking doesn't distract the reader from the content</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Vocabulary</strong><br>I reviewed the good vocabulary in <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2017/04/ielts-vocabulary-review.html">this lesson</a>. Remember that your vocabulary score comes from your use of 'topic vocabulary', not linking words or phrases.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar</strong><br>The essay contains a mix of long and short sentences, and there are no mistakes. Remember: as soon as you use connecting words like <em>and</em>, <em>while</em> or <em>which</em>, you will automatically create compound or complex sentences, so there's no need to worry about "complex grammatical structures".</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here's my full band 9 essay. I'll analyse it in next week's lesson.</p>
<p><em><strong>Some universities now offer their courses on the Internet so that people can study online. Is this a positive or negative development?</strong></em></p>
<p>It is true that online courses are becoming a common feature of university education. Although there are some drawbacks of Internet-based learning, I would argue that there are far more benefits.</p>
<p>The main drawback of the trend towards online university courses is that there is less direct interaction. Students may not have the opportunity to engage face-to-face with their teachers, and will instead have to rely on written forms of communication. Similarly, students who study online do not come into direct contact with each other, and this could have a negative impact on peer support, discussion and exchange of ideas. For example, whereas students on traditional courses can attend seminars and even discuss their subjects over coffee after lessons, online learners are restricted to chatting through website forum areas. These learners may also lack the motivation and element of competition that face-to-face group work brings.</p>
<p>Despite the negatives mentioned above, I believe that online university courses are a positive development for various reasons. Firstly, they allow learners to study in a flexible way, meaning that they can work whenever and wherever is convenient, and they can cover the material at their own pace. Secondly, the cost of a university education can be greatly reduced, while revenues for institutions may increase as more students can be taught. Finally, online learning offers open access to anybody who is willing to study, regardless of age, location, ability and background. For example, my uncle, who is 65 years old, has recently enrolled on an online MBA course in a different country, which would have been impossible in the days before Internet-based education.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while I recognise the possible disadvantages of online learning, I consider it to be a positive development overall.</p>

				<p>Remember that 'grammar' is only 25% of your writing and speaking scores. I think you'll improve your scores faster if you focus on the other 75%.</p>
<p>In the writing test, the other 75% comes from your ideas, vocabulary and essay organisation. In the speaking test, the 75% comes from your fluency and coherence, vocabulary and pronunciation. Why not spend more time on those things instead of worrying so much about grammar?</p>

	<p>
				<p>If the question asks you <strong><em>'Is this a positive or negative development?'</em></strong>, you are being asked to give your opinion. Therefore, I consider this to be an "opinion" question, similar to the question <em><strong>'To what extent do you agree or disagree?'</strong></em>.</p>

	<p>
				<p>People often ask me about the grammar score in IELTS writing. For example, here's a typical question:</p>
<p><em><span id="comment-6a0120a5bb05d8970c01b7c8df2225970b-content">What exactly are examiners looking for in terms of “grammatical range and accuracy”?</span> <span id="comment-6a0120a5bb05d8970c01b7c8df2225970b-content">Are there any specific tenses or types of sentence that should be included in the essay?</span></em></p>
<p>Here's my answer:</p>
<p>The main thing is to reduce the number of mistakes that you make. An essay that contains no mistakes is likely to get a 9 for grammar, regardless of the types of sentence that it may or may not contain.</p>
<p>There is nothing in the scoring criteria about including specific tenses or sentence constructions. If there is a nice mix of long and short sentences in your essay, you'll meet the grammar requirements. Remember: as soon as you write a "long" sentence you are naturally going to use connectives (linking words), which will make the sentence 'compound' or 'complex'. So, don't think too much about the grammar - just aim to reduce the number of mistakes that you make, and try to include a few longer sentences.</p>

<p>In my opinion, people buy new things rather than repairing damaged items because manufacturers and advertisers encourage this behaviour. Companies know that to maximise profits they must constantly update their products. They do this either by making technological improvements, especially in the case of gadgets like phones and laptops, or by creating new fashions, in the case of items like clothes or homeware. As a result, consumer goods quickly become obsolete, and there is no incentive for people to repair damaged items when a new and more desirable model is available. Furthermore, modern products tend to be difficult to repair, and it is often cheaper to simply buy a replacement.</p>
<p><em><strong>Analyse the paragraph by considering the following questions:</strong></em></p>
<ol>
<li>Is it a "firstly, secondly, finally" paragraph or an "idea, explain, example" paragraph?</li>

	<p>
				<p>I've written about this many times before, but I still hear from many people who think that the way to get a higher score is by using big, difficult or 'original' words.</p>
<p>For example, a student commented recently that she had improved her English by learning the words <em>ameliorate</em>, <em>juggernaut</em> and <em>katzenjammer</em>. I can honestly say that I had never seen or heard the word 'katzenjammer' before. My dictionary says that it is an informal and old-fashioned word that was used in the US, which explains why I didn't know it. If you use a word like that in your IELTS essay, your writing will look very strange!</p>
<p>Please don't waste your time learning strange words. Instead, read through the writing lessons on this website, and try to copy the writing style that I use.</p>

<p><em>It is true that people tend to discard their old or damaged possessions these days, rather than repairing them. There are various reasons why we behave in this way, and it seems to me that the effects are largely negative.</em></p>

	<p>
				<p>Some IELTS students spend a lot of time preparing "difficult" sentence structures to impress the examiner. One particular issue that people ask me about is the use of 'compound' and 'complex' sentences.</p>
<p>The first thing I would say about compound and complex sentences is that they are not "difficult". Here in the UK, children learn about these sentence structures in primary school (<a href="http://www.theschoolrun.com/what-are-simple-compound-and-complex-sentences-0">click here</a> to see how children are taught to understand sentence types). If you use words like <em><strong>and, but, because, although, while, when</strong></em> to connect ideas, you will automatically write a longer sentence that will be either compound or complex.</p>
<p>The second thing I would say is that you should not be worrying about these things when you are writing an IELTS essay. Just focus on answering the question and explaining your ideas well. I'm sure you'll naturally use "connecting" words to join ideas and create some longer sentences, so there's no need to worry about this at all.</p>

				<p>Whenever I do a course on IELTS writing here in Manchester, I always ask the students this question at the end of the day:</p>
<p><em>What did I teach you today that will <strong>change</strong> the way you do the test?</em></p>
<p>One of the most common answers that students give me is: <em>doing a good essay plan and <strong>numbering</strong> the ideas in the plan.</em> (as shown in <a href="http://subscriptions.viddler.com/SimonCorcoran/fkvcqe">this video lesson</a>)</p>
<p>If you put the numbers 1 to 5 next to the ideas that you have for each main paragraph, your only task when writing the essay is to turn those 5 ideas into 5 full sentences. Practise doing this, and you'll find that paragraph writing becomes much easier.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Read my full essay for the question below. I've tried to keep it as concise as possible, but it's still good enough for a band 9 score.</p>
<p><em><strong>It is inevitable that traditional cultures will be lost as technology develops. Technology and traditional cultures are incompatible. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this view?</strong></em></p>
<p>Some people believe that technological developments lead to the loss of traditional cultures. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I partly agree with this assertion</span>; while it may be true in the case of some societies, others seem to be unaffected by technology and the modern world.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the advances in technology that have driven industrialisation in developed countries have certainly contributed to the disappearance of traditional ways of life. For example, in pre-industrial Britain, generations of families grew up in the same small village communities. These communities had a strong sense of identity, due to their shared customs and beliefs. However, developments in transport, communications and manufacturing led to the dispersal of families and village communities as people moved to the cities in search of work. Nowadays most British villages are inhabited by commuters, many of whom do not know their closest neighbours.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in some parts of the world traditional cultures still thrive. There are tribes in the Amazon Rainforest, for example, that have been completely untouched by the technological developments of the developed world. These tribal communities continue to hunt and gather food from the forest, and traditional skills are passed on to children by parents and elders. Other traditional cultures, such as farming communities in parts of Africa, are embracing communications technologies. Mobile phones give farmers access to information, from weather predictions to market prices, which helps them to prosper and therefore supports their culture.</p>
<p>In conclusion, many traditional ways of life have been lost as a result of advances in technology, but other traditional communities have survived and even flourished.</p>

	<p>
				<p>The word "culture" is tricky because it can be used as an uncountable or a countable noun. It also has various meanings. A better understanding of this word will help you with the <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2017/02/ielts-writing-task-2-three-possible-introductions.html">writing task</a> that we've been working on, so let's look at some definitions and uses.</p>
<p><strong>1. Culture (uncountable): don't use with "a", don't make it plural<br></strong></p>
<p>This means the customs, beliefs, way of life, art, music, literature or social organisation of a group of people.</p>
<p>For example:<br>- I'm studying European culture. (everything from beliefs to art)<br>- This city is full of culture and history. (art, old buildings, traditional food etc.)</p>
<p><strong>2. Culture (countable): a culture / different cultures</strong></p>
<p>When we make 'culture' countable, we are <em><strong>usually*</strong></em> talking about the group of people itself. So, 'a culture' can be similar to 'a society' or 'a community'.</p>
<p>For example:<br>- Children are taught to respect different cultures. (different groups of people)<br>- Traditional cultures are disappearing. (traditional societies or communities)</p>
<p><strong>*Note:</strong><br>You might also see "a culture" used to describe an "attitude" e.g. The manager is trying to create a culture of success.</p>

				<p>In the speaking test, you can use conversational (less formal) phrases that you wouldn't use in the writing test. Here are some examples from yesterday's lesson:</p>
<ul>
<li>leave something until the last minute</li>
<li>work flat out (meaning: work hard without stopping)</li>

<li>one in particular that I really struggled with</li>
<li>put something off (meaning: avoid doing it)</li>
<li>in the end</li>
<li>have mixed feelings about</li>
<li>get started on something</li>
<li>to go through it again (meaning: to do or experience something again)</li>
</ul>
<p>I also used some good words and phrases that would be suitable for both speaking and writing (i.e. this vocabulary is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> informal):</p>
<ul>
<li>procrastinating</li>
<li>producing a final draft</li>
<li>complete the final draft</li>

<li>manage the task in an efficient way</li>
<li>I limited myself to just ten research sources</li>
<li>summarise and synthesise</li>
<li>I was relieved and quite impressed with myself</li>

				<p>Last week I asked you to think about this question:</p>
<p><em><strong>It is inevitable that traditional cultures will be lost as technology develops. Technology and traditional cultures are incompatible. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this view?</strong></em></p>
<p>There are basically three ways to answer this question: you can agree, disagree or partly agree. So here are three possible introductions:</p>
<p><strong>1. Agree</strong><br>It is true that technology is developing at an incredible rate, and that traditional societies and cultural practices are disappearing as a result. I therefore agree with the view that technology and traditional cultures cannot coexist.</p>
<p><strong>2. Disagree</strong><br>Some people would argue that technological developments lead to the disappearance of traditional societies and cultural practices. I completely disagree with this view because I see no reason why technology cannot coexist with traditional cultures and even enhance them.</p>
<p><strong>3. Partly agree / balanced opinion</strong><br>Some people believe that technological developments lead to the disappearance of traditional cultures. While this may be true in the case of some societies or customs, others seem to be unaffected by technology and the modern world.</p>
<p><em><strong>Tip:</strong></em><br>There isn't a 'best way' to answer, so the three introductions above are equally good. You should choose your answer according to the ideas that you have when you do your essay plan.</p>

<p><em><strong>It is inevitable that traditional cultures will be lost as technology develops. Technology and traditional cultures are incompatible. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this view?</strong></em></p>
<p>Here are some things to consider:</p>
<ol>
<li>What are "traditional cultures"? It might help if we start with some examples. If you can't think of any, search on the Internet and see what you find. Then choose a couple of easy examples (e.g. the first example I found was the Inuit / Eskimo culture).</li>
<li>Think about whether traditional cultures are being lost in your country. Are people from traditional societies moving to cities and joining "modern culture", or is technology helping them to keep their cultures alive?</li>
<li>Think about the words "inevitable" and "incompatible". These are very strong words! Why can't technology and traditional cultures exist together?</li>
<li>Is there a balanced answer here? Are some traditional cultures being lost while others remain strong? Is technology the only thing that destroys traditional cultures, or just part of the problem? Do some cultures simply choose to ingore new technologies?</li>
</ol>
<p>I think the question is trickier than it first seems, so let's consider the above points carefully before we write or even plan anything!</p>

	<p>
				<p>A student wrote to me with a useful question:</p>
<p><em>"My IELTS teacher told us not to mention complex subjects and show off knowledge in the speaking test. I tend to talk about my major using big words and terms to expand my answers. Would this be seen as "showing off knowledge"? And what do you think about this advice?"</em></p>
<p>To answer this question, let's compare two answers to the question "how often do you eat chocolate?":</p>
<p><strong>Answer 1:</strong><br>I probably eat something that contains chocolate, like a chocolate bar or a cake, every couple of days.</p>
<p><strong>Answer 2:</strong><br>I try to keep my chocolate intake to a minimum because it is relatively high in calories, and because sugary foods can lead to insulin resistance.</p>
<p>The second answer might look more difficult and impressive, but it actually seems inappropriate and unnatural. I much prefer the first answer. So, I think this is what the teacher meant when he/she advised students not to "show off their knowledge", and I agree with this advice.</p>

	<p>
				<p>It's a good idea to practise converting basic notes into full sentences. For example, the notes below come from an essay plan for the question about banning mobile phones (which you can see <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2016/12/ielts-writing-task-2-answer-both-parts.html">here</a>).</p>
<ol>
<li>cigarettes - toxic fumes, passive smoking, health issues</li>
<li>mobile phones - loud conversations - annoying, not dangerous</li>
<li>instead of banning, encourage polite behaviour</li>
<li>e.g. turning phones off in cinema - respect</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Let's convert the above notes into full sentences:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Cigarettes produce toxic fumes which are inhaled by others; this is known as passive smoking, and can lead to serious health issues.</li>
<li>While loud conversations on mobile phones can be annoying for others, this is not comparable with the dangers of inhaling cigarette smoke.</li>
<li>Rather than imposing a ban, it is much more sensible to encourage polite mobile phone behaviour.</li>
<li>In cinemas, for instance, the audience is politely asked to turn phones off during the film, and most people respect this request.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you can convert notes into sentences, you'll be able to convert an essay plan into a full essay. So practise doing this as much as you can!</p>

<p>Do we say "I <span style="text-decoration: underline;">saw</span> him <span style="text-decoration: underline;">go</span>" or "I <span style="text-decoration: underline;">saw</span> him <span style="text-decoration: underline;">went</span>"?</p>
<p>Hopefully the easy example above makes the grammar point much clearer. "Companies A and B <span style="text-decoration: underline;">saw</span> waste output f<span style="text-decoration: underline;">a</span>ll" and "I <span style="text-decoration: underline;">saw</span> him <span style="text-decoration: underline;">go</span>" are of course correct.</p>

<p>Now look at the two questions below. A student wrote to me this week to ask whether they should be treated as "opinion" or "discussion" questions.</p>
<ol>
<li>Is this a positive or negative development?</li>
<li>Do the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?</li>
</ol>
<p>What do you think? Which of the four question categories (opinion, discussion, problem / solution, two-part question) do the above questions fit into? And can you find any previous lessons on this website that could help the student who asked me about this?</p>

	<p>
				<p>Last week I showed you the question below, and I asked you to think about which part of the question to answer. Hopefully you realised that it would be better to answer both parts.</p>
<p><em><strong>The use of mobile phones in public places is as antisocial as smoking. Smoking is banned in certain places, so mobile phones should be banned in the same way. To what extent do you agree or disagree?</strong></em></p>
<p>So, let's look at the two statements separately.</p>
<p><em><strong>1) The use of mobile phones in public places is as antisocial as smoking.</strong></em></p>
<p>This is clearly an opinion, not a fact. We can either agree with the view that the use of mobiles is as antisocial as smoking, or we can disagree. This gives us the perfect topic for our first main body paragraph.</p>
<p><em><strong>2) Smoking is banned in certain places, so mobile phones should be banned in the same way.</strong></em></p>
<p>This is also somebody's opinion, and you can choose to agree or disagree with it in your second main paragraph. Of course, what you write here will depend on the opinion that you gave in the first main paragraph.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em><br>- I don't recommend a "partly agree" answer for this question; it will be much easier to either agree or disagree (i.e. have a strong opinion).<br>- If the question contains <span style="text-decoration: underline;">two</span> opinion statements, we can usually write a main paragraph about each one.</p>

	<p>
				<p>A student asked me: Can I use the words <em>pros and cons, leaps and bounds, merits and demerits</em>?</p>
<p><strong>Here's my simple answer:</strong></p>
<p>No. I don't recommend using any of those words in your IELTS test. I never use them, so why would you use them? By the way, if you want to check whether I use a word, <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2016/07/ielts-advice-search-this-website.html">click here</a> and follow the advice about how to search my website.</p>
<p><strong>Here's a longer answer:</strong></p>
<p>Why are you asking about those words? If you are studying vocabulary, you should be focusing on <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2011/12/ielts-vocabulary-topic-specific-vocabulary.html">'topic-specific' vocabulary</a>, not 'generic' language (words and phrases that can be used in any essay). Linking words and other generic words or phrases might be necessary in terms of essay structure, but they don't help your vocabulary score. That's why, for linking and organisation, I prefer to use 'normal' vocabulary like firstly, secondly, finally, however, on the one hand, on the other hand, furthermore, advantages, disadvantages, benefits, positives etc. There is no need to find less common alternatives for these words and phrases.</p>
<p><strong>Finally, a quick explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>"pros and cons" is a bit too informal for IELTS writing.</li>
<li>"leaps and bounds" is an informal phrase that we use to talk about improvements e.g. "Since living in the UK, my English has come on in leaps and bounds" (meaning: my English has improved a lot). You might be able to use this in the speaking test, but don't use it in an essay.</li>
<li>"merits and demerits" is not a good alternative for "advantages and disadvantages". I've never used the word "demerits" in my life.</li>

	<p>
				<p>Read the full essay that my students and I wrote for the 'festivals' question below. Can you highlight the features that help this essay to get a band 9?</p>
<p><em><strong>Most people have forgotten the meaning behind traditional or religious festivals; during festival periods, people nowadays only want to enjoy themselves. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?</strong></em></p>
<p>Some people argue that we no longer remember the original meaning of festivals, and that most of us treat them as opportunities to have fun. While I agree that enjoyment seems to be the priority during festival times, I do not agree that people have forgotten what these festivals mean.</p>
<p>On the one hand, religious and traditional festivals have certainly become times for celebration. In the UK, Christmas is a good example of a festival period when people are most concerned with shopping, giving and receiving presents, decorating their homes and enjoying traditional meals with their families. Most people look forward to Christmas as a holiday period, rather than a time to practise religion. Similar behaviour can be seen during non-religious festivals, such as Bonfire Night. People associate this occasion with making fires, watching firework displays, and perhaps going to large events in local parks; in other words, enjoyment is people’s primary goal.</p>
<p>However, I disagree with the idea that the underlying meaning of such festivals has been forgotten. In UK primary schools, children learn in detail about the religious reasons for celebrating Christmas, Easter and a variety of festivals in other religions. For example, in late December, children sing Christmas songs which have a religious content, and they may even perform nativity plays telling the story of Jesus’ birth. Families also play a role in passing knowledge of religious festivals’ deeper significance on to the next generation. The same is true for festivals that have a historical background, such as Bonfire Night or Halloween, in the sense that people generally learn the stories behind these occasions at an early age.</p>
<p>In conclusion, although people mainly want to enjoy themselves during festivals, I believe that they are still aware of the reasons for these celebrations.</p>

	<p>
				<p>The best way to answer the question below depends on your own personal experience of traditional and religious festivals in your country.</p>
<p><em><strong>Most people have forgotten the meaning behind traditional or religious festivals; during festival periods, people nowadays only want to enjoy themselves. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?</strong></em></p>
<p>Last week I recommended that we should start by thinking of some examples before we decide how to answer this question. I'm English, so the easiest examples for me are: Christmas and Easter (religious festivals), Halloween and Bonfire Night (traditional festivals). Now let's look at two possible ways that I could answer.</p>
<p><strong>Completely agree</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Introduction: completely agree</li>
<li>Paragraph about religious festivals</li>
<li>Paragraph about traditional festivals</li>
<li>Conclusion</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Partly agree</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Introduction: partly agree - people mainly want to enjoy themselves, but we do still remember the meaning behind festivals</li>
<li>Paragraph about people enjoying festivals</li>
<li>Paragraph about remembering the meaning</li>
<li>Conclusion</li>
</ol>

	<p>
				<p>Can you suggest an appropriate conclusion to finish my essay below?</p>
<p><em><strong>Extreme sports such as sky diving and skiing are very dangerous and should be banned. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this view?</strong></em></p>
<p>In recent years, extreme sports have become increasingly popular, and some people argue that governments should prohibit them. I completely disagree with the idea that these sports are too dangerous, and I therefore believe that they should not be banned.</p>
<p>In my opinion, so-called extreme sports are not as dangerous as many people think. All sports involve some element of risk, and there should always be clear regulations and safety procedures to reduce the possibility of accidents. People who take part in extreme sports are usually required to undergo appropriate training so that the dangers are minimised. For example, anyone who wants to try skydiving will need to sign up for lessons with a registered club, and beginners are not allowed to dive solo; they must be accompanied by an experienced professional. Finally, the protective equipment and technology used in sports from motor racing to mountain climbing is constantly improving safety.</p>
<p>While I support regulations and safety measures, I believe that it would be wrong, and almost impossible, to ban extreme sports. In the first place, we should all be free to decide how we spend our leisure time; as long as we understand the risks, I do not believe that politicians should stop us from enjoying ourselves. However, an even stronger argument against such a ban would be the difficulty of enforcing it. Many of the most risky sports, like base jumping or big wave surfing, are practised far away from the reach of any authorities. I cannot imagine the police being called to stop people from parachuting off a mountain face or surfing on an isolated beach.</p>

	<p>
				<p>A student asked me recently which preposition to use with the word 'spending'. But there isn't an easy answer to this question. Here are a few possible phrases:</p>
<p>- spending <strong>on</strong> food<br>- spending <strong>by</strong> teenagers<br>- spending <strong>in</strong> the UK<br>- spending <strong>during</strong> the summer holiday<br>- spending <strong>throughout</strong> October<br>- spending <strong>in</strong> dollars<br>- spending <strong>via</strong> mobile phone apps</p>
<p>Correct use of prepositions is one of the most difficult aspects of learning English. However, instead of learning 'rules', I recommend that you simply copy the phrases that you read and hear. This is how native speakers learn to use prepositions.</p>

	<p>
				<p><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><em>(Note: I normally do a listening lesson on Tuesdays, but this week it will be on Wednesday)</em></span></p>
<p>Several people sent me this recent IELTS writing task 2 question:</p>
<p><em><strong>Extreme sports such as sky diving and skiing are very dangerous and should be banned. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this view?</strong></em></p>
<p>I looked at this question with some of my students here in Manchester, and we wrote the following essay plan.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Introduction:</strong> Topic = ban extreme sports. Answer = disagree</li>
<li><strong>First reason:</strong> These sports are not so dangerous 1) because of regulations, procedures and safety measures, 2) because of training and preparation (give an example sport), 3) because of improving equipment and technology</li>
<li><strong>Second reason:</strong> It would be wrong to ban these sports, and difficult to enforce a ban - freedom of choice - the right to enjoy yourself - risks and rewards (example) - who would decide which sports? - who would stop people from participating?</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> repeat / summarise the opinion</li>
</ol>
<p><em><strong>Tip: </strong></em>The key thing when planning this "completely disagree" answer was to find two separate reasons for the two main paragraphs. We decided to do this by disagreeing with the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">two</span> ideas that are mentioned in the question: 1) extreme sports are dangerous 2) they should be banned.</p>

	<h4><a href="https://www.ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2016/10/ielts-writing-task-2-high-salaries-essay.html">IELTS Writing Task 2: 'high salaries' essay</a></h4>
	<p>
				<p>Here's a full essay that I wrote with my students for the question below.</p>
<p><em><strong>In many countries, a small number of people earn extremely high salaries. Some people believe that this is good for the country, but others think that governments should not allow salaries above a certain level.</strong></em><br><em><strong>Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.</strong></em></p>
<p>People have different views about whether governments should introduce a maximum wage. While in some ways it may seem reasonable to allow people to earn as much as companies are willing to pay, I personally believe that employee remuneration should be capped at a certain level.</p>
<p>There are various reasons why it might be considered beneficial to allow people to be paid extremely high salaries. If companies offer excellent pay packages, they can attract the most talented people in their fields to work for them. For example, technology companies like Google are able to employ the best programmers because of the huge sums that they are willing to pay. Furthermore, these well-paid employees are likely to be highly motivated to work hard and therefore drive their businesses successfully. In theory, this should result in a thriving economy and increased tax revenues, which means that paying high salaries benefits everyone.</p>
<p>However, I agree with those who argue that there should be a maximum wage. By introducing a limit on earnings, the pay-gap between bosses and employees can be reduced. Currently, the difference between normal and top salaries is huge, and this can demotivate workers who feel that the situation is unfair. With lower executive salaries, it might become feasible to introduce higher minimum wages, and everybody would be better off. One possible consequence of greater equality could be that poverty and crime rates fall because the general population will experience an improved standard of living.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it seems to me that it would be better, on balance, for governments to set a limit on the wages of the highest earners in society.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Speaking part 1:</strong> Have you mastered the art of giving short, simple answers without hesitation? Have a look at <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2016/07/ielts-speaking-part-1-simplify.html">this lesson</a> to see some useful examples.</li>
<li><strong>Listening section 1:</strong> Can you get 10 out of 10 correct answers? If you can't, you need to do more work on this section before you worry about sections 2, 3 and 4.</li>
<li><strong>Writing task 1 introductions:</strong> If you've done enough practice, you should find it easy to write task 1 introductions. Use the method in <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2010/08/ielts-writing-task-1-how-to-write-an-introduction.html">this lesson</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Writing task 2 introductions and conclusions:</strong> Practise writing introductions like <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2012/11/ielts-writing-task-2-introduction-technique.html">this</a> and conclusions like <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2013/05/ielts-writing-task-2-quick-conclusions.html">this</a>.</li>

				<p>Someone asked me about the following phrase, which describes a band 9 task response in writing task 2:</p>
<p><em>"presents a fully developed position with relevant, fully extended and well supported ideas"</em></p>
<p>Is it really possible to "fully extend and support" your ideas in such a short essay? Probably not. If you had time to write 1000 words, I'm sure you could extend and support your ideas more fully.</p>
<p>However, we shouldn't "overthink" this problem. Examiners know that it's impossible to write a truly perfect, fully developed answer in just 250 words. They understand the limitations of the task, and (hopefully!) they use their common sense. Instead of worrying about the precise meaning of the band descriptions, it's best to simply focus on answering the question as well as you can.</p>

				<p>Occasionally I like to use this blog to share my thoughts about how to achieve goals. Here's a summary of what I believe are the keys to success in IELTS, or in any other endeavour:</p>
<p><strong>1) The best information</strong><br>If you want to achieve something, you first need to find the best source of information and guidance that you can.</p>
<p><strong>2) Persistent work</strong><br>Of course, you'll need to use the information that you have and take action. You'll need to do the regular practice that leads to improvement.</p>
<p><strong>3) Positive attitude</strong> (or <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2014/11/ielts-reading-multiple-choice.html">growth mindset</a>)<br>If you have the right guidance and you're working hard, you need to be positive and patient. Try not to waste time worrying; instead, trust the process and know that you will improve gradually. Don't expect fast or easy results.</p>
<p><strong>4) Measure your progress</strong><br>Finally, you need to find a way to analyse the work that you produce. This will allow you to learn from your mistakes and make any necessary changes to your approach. Also, tracking your progress will give you confidence that you are moving towards your goal.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here's my full essay for the question that we've been looking at in recent weeks (see below). It's a bit longer than necessary, but I decided not to cut it down.</p>
<p><em><strong>Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a way to live with it. To what extent do you agree or disagree?</strong></em></p>
<p>Climate change represents a major threat to life on Earth, but some people argue that we need to accept it rather than try to stop it. I completely disagree with this opinion, because I believe that we still have time to tackle this issue and reduce the human impact on the Earth's climate.</p>
<p>There are various measures that governments and individuals could take to prevent, or at least mitigate, climate change. Governments could introduce laws to limit the carbon dioxide emissions that lead to global warming. They could impose “green taxes” on drivers, airline companies and other polluters, and they could invest in renewable energy production from solar, wind or water power. As individuals, we should also try to limit our contribution to climate change, by becoming more energy efficient, by flying less, and by using bicycles and public transport. Furthermore, the public can affect the actions of governments by voting for politicians who propose to tackle climate change, rather than for those who would prefer to ignore it.</p>
<p>If instead of taking the above measures we simply try to live with climate change, I believe that the consequences will be disastrous. To give just one example, I am not optimistic that we would be able to cope with even a small rise in sea levels. Millions of people would be displaced by flooding, particularly in countries that do not have the means to safeguard low-lying areas. These people would lose their homes and their jobs, and they would be forced to migrate to nearby cities or perhaps to other countries. The potential for human suffering would be huge, and it is likely that we would see outbreaks of disease and famine, as well as increased homelessness and poverty.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it is clear to me that we must address the problem of climate change, and I disagree with those who argue that we can find ways to live with it.</p>

<p>For example, I used "pick up" to mean "collect" (I was waiting for my colleague to collect me), but "pick up" can also mean improve, learn quickly, or receive.

	<p>
				<p>Recently I've heard from quite a few people whose writing scores were raised from 6.5 to band 7 after they asked for a re-mark. This suggests that some examiners are a bit too cautious when marking, especially at the higher levels.</p>
<p>There are no guarantees when you ask for a re-mark. However, if you think you did well in the <em><strong>writing</strong></em> test, if you got higher scores in the other three parts, and if you missed your target by only half a band, it might be worth a try.</p>
<p>Please share your experiences of re-marking in the comments below.</p>

	<p>
				<p>In <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2015/02/ielts-writing-task-2-essay-skeleton.html">this lesson</a> I explained my idea of the 'essay skeleton' - the basic structure of an IELTS essay, which consists of the introduction, a topic sentence for each main paragraph, and the conclusion.</p>
<p>Here's a possible essay skeleton for the <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2016/08/ielts-writing-task-2-introduction-and-plan.html">climate change</a> question that we started looking at last week:<br>..........</p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>Climate change represents a major threat to life on Earth, but some people argue that we need to accept it rather than try to stop it. I completely disagree with this opinion, because I believe that we still have time to tackle this issue and reduce the human impact on the Earth's climate.</p>
<p><strong>Paragraph 2 topic sentence</strong><br>There are various measures that governments and individuals could take to prevent, or at least mitigate, climate change.</p>
<p><strong>Paragraph 3 topic sentence</strong><br>If instead of taking the above measures we simply try to live with climate change, I believe that the consequences will be disastrous.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br>In conclusion, it is clear to me that we must address the problem of climate change, and I disagree with those who argue that we can find ways to live with it.<br>..........</p>
<p>Can you see how the 'skeleton' communicates my overall answer very clearly? The only thing missing is the detail in paragraphs 2 and 3.</p>

	<p>
				<p>A student called Sebastian asked me the following useful question:</p>
<p><em>In writing task 2, what if I choose a strong opinion answer (e.g. completely agree) but I only have one idea? In other words, I only have an idea for one main-body paragraph, so what can I write in the second body paragraph?</em></p>
<p>Here are my tips to address Sebastian's question:</p>
<ol>
<li>You could solve this problem during your planning time, before you start writing. If you realise that you only have one idea, you still have time to change to a 'balanced' opinion answer.</li>
<li>Alternatively, you could use the <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2010/10/ielts-writing-task-2-tourism.html">'perspectives'</a> approach to planning. This might help you to divide your main idea into two parts (e.g. the same idea from an individual perspective and from a social or economic perspective).</li>
<li>Another method that I use is to support my opinion in paragraph 2, and then refute the opposite opinion in paragraph 3. This is the essay structure that I suggested in Wednesday's <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2016/08/ielts-writing-task-2-introduction-and-plan.html">lesson</a>.

	<p>
				<p>People are often surprised when I tell them to stop thinking about 'academic' language, complex grammar or 'difficult' words. In <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2016/05/ielts-writing-task-2-ignore-the-word-academic.html">this lesson</a>, for example, I suggest that IELTS writing task 2 is more like a high school essay than a university assignment.</p>
<p>Here's some feedback from a student in relation to this advice:</p>
<p><em>Hi Simon,</em></p>
<p><em>I was initially very sceptical of your "high school" writing approach. I believed in a complicated, "academic" style writing with flashy words and complex sentences. Well, I was wrong.</em></p>
<p><em>With that mindset, on the IELTS test day I confidently penned a monstrous 400-word essay with multiple metaphors, symbolism, lengthy sentences, and analyses of complex real-world examples. I ended up getting a band 7 for writing (L9, R9, S8.5).</em></p>
<p><em>I was very surprised. What I came to understand is that the IELTS encourages clear, concise and coherent writing more than anything else. It really is a high school writing task. If I ever take the IELTS test again, I will make absolutely sure to follow the simple and effective strategy that you advocate.</em></p>

	<h4><a href="https://www.ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2016/07/ielts-writing-task-2-economic-progress-essay.html">IELTS Writing Task 2: 'economic progress' essay</a></h4>
	<p>
				<p>Here's the full essay that I wrote with my students for the question below.</p>
<p><em><strong>Many governments think that economic progress is their most important goal. Some people, however, think that other types of progress are equally important for a country. <br>Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.</strong></em></p>
<p>People have different views about how governments should measure their countries’ progress. While economic progress is of course essential, I agree with those who believe that other measures of progress are just as important.</p>
<p>There are three key reasons why economic growth is seen as a fundamental goal for countries. Firstly, a healthy economy results in job creation, a high level of employment, and better salaries for all citizens. Secondly, economic progress ensures that more money is available for governments to spend on infrastructure and public services. For example, a government with higher revenues can invest in the country's transport network, its education system and its hospitals. Finally, a strong economy can help a country’s standing on the global stage, in terms of its political influence and trading power.</p>
<p>However, I would argue that various other forms of progress are just as significant as the economic factors mentioned above. In particular, we should consider the area of social justice, human rights, equality and democracy itself. For example, the treatment of minority groups is often seen as a reflection of the moral standards and level of development of a society. Perhaps another key consideration when judging the progress of a modern country should be how well that country protects the natural environment, and whether it is moving towards environmental sustainability. Alternatively, the success of a nation could be measured by looking at the health, well-being and happiness of its residents.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the economy is obviously a key marker of a country’s success, but social, environmental and health criteria are equally significant.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Some students (and teachers) think that it's a good idea to write a long introduction. I disagree, and I recommend that you keep the introduction short. Let's compare some examples.</p>
<p><strong>My short introduction:</strong><br>People have different views about how best to improve transportation in cities. While better provision for cyclists would be a positive measure, I would argue that further investment in public transport should be the priority in most cities.</p>
<p><strong>A long introduction written by a student:</strong><br>Nowadays, there is a large debate around the ideal transportation means that should be promoted by governments. Some believe that means like bicycles should be supported, while others feel that spending should be directed toward public transportations. I think that both means have to be subsidized because each has advantages and potential disadvantages. In this essay, I shall discuss and analyze both views.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong><br>The long introduction above is a little repetitive, but otherwise it's fine. The main problem is the extra time that you waste if you write four sentences instead of two. This is time that could be spent on the main body paragraphs, which are the key to a high score. A long introduction won't help your score at all, but longer and better main body paragraphs will.</p>

	<p>
				<p>In last week's <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2016/06/ielts-writing-task-2-discussion-with-opinion.html">lesson</a> I asked you to think about where you would put your opinion in an essay about the question below.</p>
<p><em><strong>Some people think that more money should be spent to promote the use of bicycles in cities. Others, however, believe that cities should focus on investing in public transport systems.</strong></em><br><em><strong>Discuss both views and give your own opinion.</strong></em></p>
<p>Let's start with the introduction and conclusion. My general 'rule' for these paragraphs is that they should cover everything that the question asks you to cover. This means that your opinion should be clear in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">both</span>. Here are my examples:</p>
<p><strong>Introduction:</strong><br>People have different views about how best to improve transportation in cities. While better provision for cyclists would be a positive measure, <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">I would argue</span> that further investment in public transport should be the priority in most cities.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br>In conclusion, although I hope that cities will become more bicycle-friendly in the future, <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">I believe</span> that more money should be spent on public transport infrastructure than on the promotion of cycling.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Instead of correcting every grammar mistake, an easier way to improve the introduction paragraph in yesterday's lesson would be to simplify it. To simplify something, we need to focus on the <em><strong>message</strong></em> that we are trying to communicate; how can we deliver that message in the clearest, simplest way?</p>
<p>For example, here's a simplified version of the introduction:</p>
<p><em>Many people are confident that this century will be a positive one. I share this optimism, and there are several positive changes that I hope to see over the coming years.</em></p>

				<p>Last week I did some IELTS teacher training at Liverpool University. Afterwards, I asked the teachers what they found most useful about the session, and three things stood out:</p>
<ol>
<li>They liked my advice on essay planning for writing task 2. In particular, they thought that numbering the ideas in the plan was really useful. Watch <a href="http://subscriptions.viddler.com/SimonCorcoran/fkvcqe">this video</a> to see an example.</li>
<li>They had a clearer understanding of the differences between IELTS writing and university academic writing e.g. using <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2012/01/ielts-writing-task-2-using-the-word-i.html">the word "I"</a>.</li>
<li>They liked the idea that <em><strong>it's easier to get faster than it is to get better</strong></em>. Don't worry if it takes you <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2011/08/ielts-advice-the-four-hour-essay.html">four hours</a> to write a band 7 essay; the important thing is that you're achieving that score.

<p>Here's the reason: the question contains the phrase "as well as".

	<p>
				<p>Here's my full essay for the question below.</p>
<p><em><strong>As well as making money, businesses also have social responsibilities. To what extent do you agree or disagree?</strong></em></p>
<p>Businesses have always sought to make a profit, but it is becoming increasingly common to hear people talk about the social obligations that companies have. I completely agree with the idea that businesses should do more for society than simply make money.</p>
<p>On the one hand, I accept that businesses must make money in order to survive in a competitive world. It seems logical that the priority of any company should be to cover its running costs, such as employees’ wages and payments for buildings and utilities. On top of these costs, companies also need to invest in improvements and innovations if they wish to remain successful. If a company is unable to pay its bills or meet the changing needs of customers, any concerns about social responsibilities become irrelevant. In other words, a company can only make a positive contribution to society if it is in good financial health.</p>
<p>On the other hand, companies should not be run with the sole aim of maximising profit; they have a wider role to play in society. One social obligation that owners and managers have is to treat their employees well, rather than exploiting them. For example, they could pay a “living wage” to ensure that workers have a good quality of life. I also like the idea that businesses could use a proportion of their profits to support local charities, environmental projects or education initiatives. Finally, instead of trying to minimise their tax payments by using accounting loopholes, I believe that company bosses should be happy to contribute to society through the tax system.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I believe that companies should place as much importance on their social responsibilities as they do on their financial objectives.</p>

				<p>In the IELTS speaking and writing tests, the most important thing is to answer the question. This seems obvious, but many students are so worried about using 'difficult grammar' that they don't give <em><strong>relevant</strong></em> answers.</p>
<p>In the speaking test, listen carefully to the question and answer it as if you were speaking to a friend. Try to speak without thinking too much; forget the grammar and just have a normal conversation.</p>
<p>In the writing test, take some time to understand each question and plan your answer. Check the question every time you write a new idea; make sure that everything you write is <em><strong>relevant</strong></em>. If part of your answer is not related to the topic you will lose marks, even if your grammar is perfect.</p>

				<p>It's nice to finish your essay with a conclusion, but I'd say that the conclusion is the least important part of your essay. Don't worry too much if you don't have time to write one; your main body paragraphs are much more important.</p>
<p>I advise people to write short, fast conclusions. Just paraphrase the overall answer that you gave in your introduction. For example:</p>
<p><strong>My introduction from last week's lesson:</strong><br>Businesses have always sought to make a profit, but it is becoming increasingly common to hear people talk about the social obligations that companies have. I completely agree with the idea that businesses should do more for society than simply make money.</p>

	<p>
				<p>In yesterday's lesson I asked why teachers often give students the wrong advice about IELTS writing. This can happen even with teachers who are generally very good at teaching English.</p>
<p>In my experience, the reason is simple:</p>
<p>Many teachers have been trained to teach<em><strong> academic writing for university</strong></em>, but they haven't had any specific <em><strong>IELTS training</strong></em>. IELTS writing follows a few different rules compared to university writing, and teachers aren't always aware of the differences. Maybe we need a list of these differences; can you think of any?</p>

	<p>
				<p>Many IELTS candidates waste time writing long introductions, because they believe that the introduction is the key to a high score.</p>
<p>This approach is wrong. The main body paragraphs are the key to a high score, so it's best to keep your introduction short. Just introduce the topic and give an overall answer to the question. For example:</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong><br>As well as making money, businesses also have social responsibilities. To what extent do you agree or disagree?</p>
<p><strong>2-sentence introduction:</strong><br>Businesses have always sought to make a profit, but it is becoming increasingly common to hear people talk about the social obligations that companies have. I completely agree with the idea that businesses should do more for society than simply make money.</p>

	<p>
				<p>In last week's lesson I asked you to think about the easiest way to answer this question:</p>
<p><em><strong>As well as making money, businesses also have social responsibilities. To what extent do you agree or disagree?</strong></em></p>
<p>For me, the easiest way would be to completely agree. Here's a quick plan for a 4-paragraph answer:</p>
<ol>
<li>Introduction: introduce the topic and completely agree</li>
<li>Main paragraph: explain why you agree that businesses need to make money, and what would happen if they didn't (perhaps mention that many social responsibilities depend on money)</li>
<li>Main paragraph: explain why you agree that businesses also have social responsibilities (give examples)</li>
<li>Conclusion: repeat / summarise your answer</li>
</ol>
<p>A few people shared more detailed plans in the comments below last week's <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2016/03/ielts-writing-task-2-choose-the-easy-opinion.html">lesson</a>. Have a look at their ideas regarding the 'social responsibilities' of businesses.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Students often don't notice when a teacher corrects their mistakes.</p>
<p>Look at this example of a conversation between a student and a teacher:</p>
<p>Student: <em>I gave the IELTS test five times.</em><br>Teacher: <em>Oh, you've taken the test five times?</em><br>Student: <em>Yes, the last time I gave it was two weeks ago.</em></p>
<p>The student doesn't notice that the teacher is correcting a mistake. In English we <em><strong>don't</strong></em> say "give a test" (unless you are the examiner giving the test to the students), we say "<em><strong>take</strong></em> a test".</p>
<p>When a teacher repeats something that you said in a different way, it's possible that you made a mistake. Listen carefully, and try to notice mistakes and corrections. If you're not sure, ask the teacher whether you made a mistake.</p>

We then wrote a band 9 paragraph together (see below).</p>
<p><strong>Paragraph answering the question 'why is happiness difficult to define?':</strong></p>
<p>Happiness is almost impossible to explain because it is an abstract concept with no definite meaning. It can mean or represent something completely different depending on a person's age, culture or background. For some people, happiness is a feeling of pleasure in a particular moment, whereas for others, it is a state of mind. Children, for example, are happiest when playing, laughing and having fun, while adults usually equate happiness with health, security, financial stability or success. In other words, we all have different views or requirements, and so we seek contentment in our own individual ways.</p>
<p><strong>But what makes this a 'band 9' paragraph?<em><br></em></strong>Can you analyse it in terms of the <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2013/10/ielts-advice-how-essays-are-marked.html">4 criteria</a>?</p>

<p>My answer is no. Although 'bring down', 'lessen' and 'cut down' can be used as synonyms of 'reduce' in some situations, most native speakers wouldn't choose to use them in the contexts above. In other words, 'reduce pollution' is a common collocation, but 'bring down pollution' isn't.</p>

				<p>Here's my full sample essay for question below.</p>
<p><em><strong>More and more people are migrating to cities in search of a better life, but city life can be extremely difficult. Explain some of the difficulties of living in a city. How can governments make urban life better for everyone?</strong></em></p>
<p>Cities are often seen as places of opportunity, but there are also some major drawbacks of living in a large metropolis. In my opinion, governments could do much more to improve city life for the average inhabitant.</p>
<p>The main problem for anyone who hopes to migrate to a large city is that the cost of living is likely to be much higher than it is in a small town or village. Inhabitants of cities have to pay higher prices for housing, transport, and even food. Another issue is that urban areas tend to suffer from social problems such as high crime and poverty rates in comparison with rural areas. Furthermore, the air quality in cities is often poor, due to pollution from traffic, and the streets and public transport systems are usually overcrowded. As a result, city life can be unhealthy and stressful.</p>
<p>However, there are various steps that governments could take to tackle these problems. Firstly, they could invest money in the building of affordable or social housing to reduce the cost of living. Secondly, politicians have the power to ban vehicles from city centres and promote the use of cleaner public transport, which would help to reduce both air pollution and traffic congestion. In London, for example, the introduction of a congestion charge for drivers has helped to curb the traffic problem. A third option would be to develop provincial towns and rural areas, by moving industry and jobs to those regions, in order to reduce the pressure on major cities.</p>
<p>In conclusion, governments could certainly implement a range of measures to enhance the quality of life for all city residents.</p>

				<p>In the comments below <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2016/02/ielts-writing-task-2-disagree-essay-with-both-sides.html">Wednesday's lesson</a>, a few people said that they didn't see any "advanced" vocabulary* in my essay. But examiners are not looking for "advanced" vocabulary; they are looking for "less common" vocabulary.</p>
<p>"Less common" vocabulary means words and phrases that most students wouldn't think to use in their essays. For example, in the first line of my essay, I used the verb "to rival". You might know the noun "rival", but have you ever used it as a verb? This is not an "advanced" word, but it is certainly <em><strong>less commonly used</strong></em> by IELTS candidates, and the examiner would be impressed to see it used in this way.</p>
<p>Here are the "less common" phrases from my essay:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Internet is beginning to rival newspapers</li>
<li>the traditional press</li>
<li>vital source of information</li>
<li>the Internet age</li>
<li>traditional means of communicating</li>
<li>rural areas</li>
<li>the ability or opportunity to get online</li>
<li>trusted as reliable sources</li>
<li>employ professional journalists and editors</li>
<li>news in real time</li>
<li>gadgets and mobile devices</li>
<li>contribute with our own updates on social media</li>
<li>an explosion in the use of platforms</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong><br>Although you probably <em><strong>understand</strong></em> the phrases above, most candidates would not <em><strong>use</strong></em> them in their essays.</p>
<p>*I never use the terms "advanced vocabulary" or "difficult vocabulary". Anyone can find a "big" word in the dictionary and translate it. The difficult skill is to use words together in&nbsp;<a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2013/03/ielts-vocabulary-band-7-or-higher.html">collocations</a> and phrases.</p>

<p><em>"According to a recent report from Oxford University, around 60% of prisoners reoffend after being released."</em></p>

	<p>
				<p>In last week's <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2016/01/ielts-writing-task-2-can-we-always-partly-agree.html">lesson</a> I explained that we sometimes need to 'disagree' if we want to write a balanced answer. I'll demonstrate how this works below.</p>
<p><em><strong>Question:</strong></em><br>Although more and more people read news on the Internet, newspapers will remain the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">most</span> important source of news. Do you agree or disagree?</p>
<p><em><strong>My introduction:</strong></em><br>The Internet is beginning to rival newspapers as the best place to find information about what is happening in the world. I believe that this trend will continue, and the Internet will soon be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">just as important</span> as the traditional press.</p>
<p><strong><em>My conclusion:</em></strong><br>In conclusion, I <span style="text-decoration: underline;">disagree</span> with the view that newspapers will continue to be the main source of news, because I believe that the Internet will soon be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">equally important</span>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em><br>Remember that I'm disagreeing with the word "most". By arguing that the Internet will become equally important, I can write about both newspapers and the Internet as sources of news.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Read the question below. Do you think it's possible to partly agree? Is it possible to write a balanced answer?</p>
<p><em><strong>Although more and more people read news on the Internet, newspapers will remain the most important source of news. Do you agree or disagree?</strong></em></p>
<p>Be careful with this type of question. Here's why:</p>
<p>Because of the word "most", <em><strong>I don't think we can 'partly agree'</strong></em>. Either we believe that newspapers <span style="text-decoration: underline;">will</span> remain the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">most</span> popular source of information (agree), or we believe that they <span style="text-decoration: underline;">won't</span> (disagree). This probably explains why the question doesn't say "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">to what extent</span> do you agree or disagree?".</p>
<p>However, <em><strong>there is a way to write a balanced answer</strong></em>: we need to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">disagree</span>. We can say that we disagree that newspapers will remain the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">most</span> important source of news, because we believe that the Internet will become <span style="text-decoration: underline;">equally</span> important. This answer allows us to write one main paragraph about each source of news.</p>
<p><em><strong>Task:</strong></em><br>Try writing a 'disagree' introduction in the way that I've suggested above.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Some students worry about being 'original'. They worry that too many other candidates might use the same ideas, vocabulary or linking words as them. For example, several people have asked me whether the examiner will notice if they use the vocabulary from my blog lessons or ebook. Others worry that simple linking words like "firstly, secondly, finally" are too common or even too 'old'.</p>
<p>So, is it true that we should worry about these things? Do candidates need to use 'new', original language in their tests?</p>
<p>The answer is no! IELTS is not testing your originality; it's testing your ability to use the English language in a normal, natural way. Don't worry about any of the things mentioned above!</p>

				<p>On a recent course, my students and I looked at the following question:</p>

				<p>Last week I asked you to think about the question below. I asked what your real opinion would be, and whether a different opinion might be easier to write about.</p>
<p><em><strong>Sports programmes are hugely popular on television nowadays. But some people argue that these programmes are to blame for the poor health of many young people who prefer to watch rather than partake in physical activity.

<p><strong>Real opinion</strong><br>Personally, my real opinion is that I completely disagree. I don't think that sports programmes are responsible for any health problems.</p>
<p><strong>Easiest opinion</strong><br>However, it might be easier to say that we "agree to a certain extent" (partly agree). This would allow us to argue that too much sport on TV may be partly to blame, but that other factors may be equally or even more important.</p>
<p><em><strong>Tip:</strong></em><br>In your exam, I recommend noting down some ideas before you decide what your opinion is. Look at your ideas, and see whether they suggest a one-sided answer or a balanced answer.</p>
<p><em><strong>Task:</strong></em><br>Try writing two different introduction paragraphs - one for my real opinion, and one for the easier opinion above.</p>

<p>Take this question for example:</p>
<p><em><strong>Sports programmes are hugely popular on television nowadays.

				<p>A student noticed something interesting in my video lesson about "discussion essays". In the lesson I wrote the following two phrases:</p>
<ol>
<li>their <span style="text-decoration: underline;">determination</span> will help them in competitive situations</li>
<li>more useful than <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a</span> competitive <span style="text-decoration: underline;">determination</span> to win</li>
</ol>
<p>The student asked why I used the article "a" in the second phrase. Isn't "determination" an uncountable noun? The answer is, not always.</p>
<p>Sometimes we use "determination" as a countable noun. In the second sentence above, I'm writing about one specific type of determination: the determination to win. In this case it's correct to write "a determination".</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em><br>People often ask me to make a lesson that explains how to use articles. The problem is that article use doesn't follow a set of simple 'rules'.

	<p>
				<p>People often worry about using words from the question in their essays.</p>
<p>While it's important to show that you can paraphrase the question and explain your ideas in a variety of ways, I believe that you <em><strong>should</strong></em> use words from the question somewhere in your essays. But why? Here are 3 reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>The first reason is easy: some words/phrases are difficult to paraphrase. For example, in my&nbsp;<a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2015/12/ielts-writing-task-2-positive-or-negative-essay.html">essay</a> about 'living alone' I found it difficult to avoid using the phrase 'live alone'. Almost every sentence refers to this topic, and nobody expects you to find ten or more different synonyms.</li>
<li>The second reason is more interesting: repeating certain key words or phrases helps to hold your essay together. The reader cannot miss the connection between ideas (whereas he/she might miss the connection if you use too many synonyms). Politicians often use this technique in their speeches e.g. Barack Obama's famous "Yes we can" speech.</li>
<li>The third reason is equally important: repeating words from the question helps to keep you "on topic". Refer to the question to show the examiner that you are answering it. This can help your 'task response' score.</li>
</ol>
<p><em><strong>Idea:</strong></em><br>Take one of my sample essays, or a sample essay from an IELTS book. Underline key words in the question, then highlight those words in the essay. If the writer used words from the question, it was probably for one of the 3 reasons above. A good essay is likely to have a nice balance between words that are taken from the question and the use of synonyms or paraphrasing.</p>

<li>His fastest running time was...</li>
<li>Britain's oldest person is...</li>

<li>The UK had <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">highest</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">revenue</span> from bananas. (noun after, use "the")</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Revenue</span> from bananas was <span style="text-decoration: underline;">highest</span> in the UK. (noun before, no "the")</li>

<li>Revenue from bananas was (at its) highest in the UK.</li>
<li>Temperatures are (at their) warmest in the south of the country.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Task:</strong><br>Here's a puzzle for you. The sentence below is correct, but it seems to break the 'rule' in point 2 above. Can you explain why I wrote "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> oldest" even though there is no noun after the superlative?</p>

				<p>In <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2011/12/ielts-grammar-highest-or-the-highest.html">this lesson</a> I gave a grammatical explanation of when to write "highest" without the word "the" before it. For example:</p>
<p>- The UK had <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>the</strong></em> highest rate</span> of unemployment. (the highest + noun)<br>- The unemployment <span style="text-decoration: underline;">rate was highest</span> in the UK. (noun before 'highest', no 'the')</p>
<p>However, there might be an easier way to remember when to miss the word "the".&nbsp; We miss the word "the" when "highest" means "at its highest" or "at their highest" e.g. The unemployment rate was<em><strong> at its highest</strong></em> in the UK.</p>
<p>Let's try this with a few more examples:</p>
<p>1. Rainfall is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">highest</span> in October. (Rainfall is <em><strong>at its highest</strong></em> in October)<br>2. Temperatures are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">warmest</span> in the south of the country. (at their warmest)<br>3. Traffic is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">slowest</span> between 7 and 9am. (at its slowest)</p>
<p>In the above examples, don't put the word "the" before the superlative adjectives.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here's my full essay for the 'positive or negative development' question that we've been looking at over the last few weeks.</p>
<p><em><strong>In some countries, many more people are choosing to live alone nowadays than in the past. Do you think this is a positive or negative development?</strong></em></p>
<p>In recent years it has become far more normal for people to live alone, particularly in large cities in the developed world. In my opinion, this trend could have both positive and negative consequences in equal measure.</p>
<p>The rise in one-person households can be seen as positive for both personal and broader economic reasons. On an individual level, people who choose to live alone may become more independent and self-reliant than those who live with family members. A young adult who lives alone, for example, will need to learn to cook, clean, pay bills and manage his or her budget, all of which are valuable life skills; an increase in the number of such individuals can certainly be seen as a positive development. From an economic perspective, the trend towards living alone will result in greater demand for housing. This is likely to benefit the construction industry, estate agents and a whole host of other companies that rely on homeowners to buy their products or services.</p>
<p>However, the personal and economic arguments given above can be considered from the opposite angle. Firstly, rather than the positive feeling of increased independence, people who live alone may experience feelings of loneliness, isolation and worry. They miss out on the emotional support and daily conversation that family or flatmates can provide, and they must bear the weight of all household bills and responsibilities; in this sense, perhaps the trend towards living alone is a negative one. Secondly, from the financial point of view, a rise in demand for housing is likely to push up property prices and rents. While this may benefit some businesses, the general population, including those who live alone, will be faced with rising living costs.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the increase in one-person households will have both beneficial and detrimental effects on individuals and on the economy.</p>

	<p>
				<p>A good way to organise your ideas is by thinking about the topic from different perspectives or points of view. <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2010/10/ielts-writing-task-2-tourism.html">Click here</a> to see another lesson about this.</p>
<p>I used the 'perspectives' technique to write a paragraph about the positives of more people living alone (see <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2015/11/ielts-writing-task-2-balanced-introduction.html">last week's lesson</a>).</p>
<p><em><strong>Here's my paragraph with the perspectives highlighted:</strong></em></p>
<p>The rise in one-person households can be seen as positive for both personal and broader economic reasons. <span style="background-color: #dbc7f0;">On an individual level</span>, people who choose to live alone may become more independent and self-reliant than those who live with family members. A young adult who lives alone, for example, will need to learn to cook, clean, pay bills and manage his or her budget, all of which are valuable life skills. <span style="background-color: #dbc7f0;">From an economic perspective</span>, the trend towards living alone will result in greater demand for housing. This is likely to benefit the construction industry, estate agents and a whole host of other companies that rely on homeowners to buy their products or services.</p>
<p><em><strong>Task:</strong></em><br>Try writing about the negatives of the same trend, from two or three different perspectives.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here's a question that a student wrote in the "comments" below one of my lessons this week:</p>
<p><em>Dear Simon,</em></p>
<p><em>I'm reading your model essays and find them easy to follow and understand. They are totally different from what I'm being trained to write in my IELTS class. We are advised to include linking words, adverbs and descriptive clauses in almost every sentence, while your sentences are much shorter and cleaner. Please give me your opinion about this difference.</em></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Note: I've corrected a few small mistakes that the student made)</span></p>
<p>For me, this is an important question because it highlights one of the main reasons why I started writing this blog: I disagree with the way that many teachers, books and websites teach IELTS, and I wanted to suggest a different approach. Examiners are pleasantly surprised when they see essays that are 'clean' and easy to follow, and you might find that your scores improve as you start to focus on <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2015/09/ielts-writing-task-2-focus-on-real-content.html">real content</a> instead of linking words and memorised phrases.</p>

	<p>
				<p>If we want to write a balanced answer for the question below, it's important to make our balanced view very clear in the introduction.</p>
<p><strong>Here's the question again:</strong></p>
<p>In some countries, many more people are choosing to live alone nowadays than in the past. Do you think this is a positive or negative development?</p>
<p><strong>Here's my 'balanced opinion' introduction:</strong></p>
<p>In recent years it has become far more normal for people to live alone, particularly in large cities in the developed world. In my opinion, this trend is having both positive and negative consequences in equal measure.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em><br>Notice that I wrote two sentences as usual. The first sentence introduces the topic by paraphrasing the question statement, and the second sentence makes my opinion very clear.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Many people ask me how they can improve their IELTS scores. In my experience, improvements tend to happen in the following way:</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c017c36ea12ad970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Screen Shot 2013-02-16 at 17.32.35" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c017c36ea12ad970b" src="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c017c36ea12ad970b-800wi" title="Screen Shot 2013-02-16 at 17.32.35"></a></p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> </em>The numbers on the graph refer to stages of improvement, not scores.</p>
<p>Here's my explanation of the four stages of improvement:</p>
<ol>
<li>When a student first starts taking IELTS lessons, they learn useful exam techniques and they do some practice tests. They often improve quite quickly at this stage.</li>
<li>However, there is a limit to the improvements that you can make with exam techniques alone. Stage 2 represents the frustrating period during which your score stays the same.</li>
<li>The only way to reach point 3 is by working hard to improve your English. There are no secrets, shortcuts or special techniques; learning a second language takes time and practice.</li>
<li>In the end, students who persist do tend to get the scores they need! (I'm afraid nobody can tell you how long this will take).</li>

<p>Here's my advice:</p>

<li>This type of question is asking for <strong><em>your</em></strong> opinion, so don't write about the views of other people.</li>
<li>Three different answers are possible: (1) You think it is a positive development. (2) You think it is a negative development. (3) You believe that there are some positives and some negatives.</li>

<p><em>"It is true of any subject that the person that succeeds has the realistic viewpoint at the beginning, and knows that the problem is large and that he has to take it a step at a time, and that he has to enjoy the step-by-step learning procedure."</em><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><br>(Bill Evans, pianist and composer)</span></p>

	<p>
				<p>One of the main messages that I try to communicate in my lessons is that 'difficult' words and grammar are not the secret to a high score. You don't need to be Shakespeare to get band 7, 8 or 9!</p>
<p>In fact, 'difficult' language often has a negative effect on people's scores. Instead of impressing the examiner, the 'difficult' language may be unnatural, inappropriate, or just incorrect.</p>
<p>Look at these examples from Sunday's <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2015/11/ielts-grammar-conditional-mistakes.html" target="_self" title="">lesson</a>. I've underlined the words that I think the students hoped would impress the examiner.</p>

<li>If schools <span style="text-decoration: underline;">administered</span> with any teachers, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">disorder</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">lawlessness</span> would <span style="text-decoration: underline;">arise</span>.</li>
<li>If <span style="text-decoration: underline;">uncensored</span> commercials had been banned, the crime rate would be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">seized from</span> rising.</li>
</ol>
<p>All of the underlined 'difficult' words are either <em><strong>used wrongly</strong></em> or they seem strange in these contexts. It would be better to write the following versions:</p>
<ol>
<li>If schools were run without teachers, the behaviour of pupils would be much worse.</li>
<li>If violent commercials were banned, the crime rate would fall.</li>

	<p>
				<p>Today I'm sharing my full essay for the question below.</p>
<p><em><strong>Some people think that all university students should study whatever they like. Others believe that they should only be allowed to study subjects that will be useful in the future, such as those related to science and technology.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.</strong></em></p>
<p>People have different views about how much choice students should have with regard to what they can study at university. While some argue that it would be better for students to be forced into certain key subject areas, I believe that everyone should be able to study the course of their choice.</p>
<p>There are various reasons why people believe that universities should only offer subjects that will be useful in the future. They may assert that university courses like medicine, engineering and information technology are more likely to be beneficial than certain art degrees. From a personal perspective, it can be argued that these courses provide more job opportunities, career progression, better salaries, and therefore an improved quality of life for students who take them. On the societal level, by forcing people to choose particular university subjects, governments can ensure that any knowledge and skill gaps in the economy are covered. Finally, a focus on technology in higher education could lead to new inventions, economic growth, and greater future prosperity.</p>
<p>In spite of these arguments, I believe that university students should be free to choose their preferred areas of study. In my opinion, society will benefit more if our students are passionate about what they are learning. Besides, nobody can really predict which areas of knowledge will be most useful to society in the future, and it may be that employers begin to value creative thinking skills above practical or technical skills. If this were the case, perhaps we would need more students of art, history and philosophy than of science or technology.</p>
<p>In conclusion, although it might seem sensible for universities to focus only on the most useful subjects, I personally prefer the current system in which people have the right to study whatever they like.</p>

				<p>Here's the question we looked at in last week's lesson:</p>
<p><em><strong>Some people think that all university students should study whatever they like. Others believe that they should only be allowed to study subjects that will be useful in the future, such as those related to science and technology.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.</strong></em></p>

<li>Topic sentence - only study useful subjects, various reasons</li>
<li>Give examples of subjects that are more useful than others</li>
<li>Personal reasons - job opportunities, career progression, high salary</li>
<li>Societal reasons - cover gaps in knowledge / skills in the economy</li>
<li>Future reason - new inventions lead to growth and future prosperity</li>

<p><span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">(1)</span> There are various reasons why people may believe that universities should only offer subjects that will be useful in the future. <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">(2)</span> It is true that university courses like medicine, engineering and information technology are more likely to be beneficial than certain art degrees. <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">(3)</span> From a personal perspective, these courses can provide more job opportunities, career progression, better salaries, and therefore an improved quality of life for students who take them. <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">(4)</span> On the societal level, by forcing people to choose the most useful university subjects, governments can ensure that any knowledge and skill gaps in the economy are covered. <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">(5)</span> Finally, a focus on technology in higher education could lead to new inventions, economic growth, and greater future prosperity.</p>

<p>When you look at a graph or chart in writing task 1, you shouldn't be thinking, "can I use the passive to describe this information?". You should be thinking, "what is the main trend, which numbers should I compare or contrast, how will I paraphrase the question etc.?".</p>

				<p>Whenever people ask me for one quick tip for writing task 2, I tell them to focus on 'real content' rather than grammar, linking or structure.</p>
<p>I'm not saying that grammar, linking and structure aren't important, but the big difference between people who get less than band 7 and people who get band 7 or higher is <em><strong>content</strong></em>.</p>
<p>'Real content' means <em><strong>ideas</strong></em> that are related to the question topic. And it means that a <em><strong>range of good vocabulary</strong></em> has been used to express those ideas.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here's my full essay for the "ex-prisoner" topic that we've been looking at over the last few weeks. Notice that I give only one opinion, and I support it in each paragraph.</p>
<p><em><strong>Some people who have been in prison become good citizens later, and it is often argued that these are the best people to talk to teenagers about the dangers of committing a crime.</strong></em><br><em><strong>To what extent do you agree or disagree?</strong></em></p>
<p>It is true that ex-prisoners can become normal, productive members of society. I completely agree with the idea that allowing such people to speak to teenagers about their experiences is the best way to discourage them from breaking the law.</p>
<p>In my opinion, teenagers are more likely to accept advice from someone who can speak from experience. Reformed offenders can tell young people about how they became involved in crime, the dangers of a criminal lifestyle, and what life in prison is really like. They can also dispel any ideas that teenagers may have about criminals leading glamorous lives. While adolescents are often indifferent to the guidance given by older people, I imagine that most of them would be extremely keen to hear the stories of an ex-offender. The vivid and perhaps shocking nature of these stories is likely to have a powerful impact.</p>
<p>The alternatives to using reformed criminals to educate teenagers about crime would be much less effective. One option would be for police officers to visit schools and talk to young people. This could be useful in terms of informing teens about what happens to lawbreakers when they are caught, but young people are often reluctant to take advice from figures of authority. A second option would be for school teachers to speak to their students about crime, but I doubt that students would see teachers as credible sources of information about this topic. Finally, educational films might be informative, but there would be no opportunity for young people to interact and ask questions.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I fully support the view that people who have turned their lives around after serving a prison sentence could help to deter teenagers from committing crimes.</p>

<p><em>"After multiple attempts of taking the exam, I was able to get my needed scores on my 4th try. What's astonishing is I got 7 in writing, my weakest part, after the remarking. I know thousands of people are struggling to get their desired scores but all I can say is 'Do not give up'. There was a time in my life where I said to myself that IELTS is just a business, dreadful and unjust. However, I continued to believe in myself."</em></p>

				<p>A colleague of mine (thanks Phil) just sent me a link to an online dictionary called <a href="http://www.yourdictionary.com" target="_self" title="">Your Dictionary</a>. The best feature of this dictionary is that it shows you lots of example sentences that include the word you searched for.</p>
<p>Try searching for a word, and then click on the 'sentences' option:</p>

				<p>Examiners don't want to be surprised by new ideas or opinions in your conclusion; they just want to read a summary of your overall answer to the question. The easiest way to do this is by paraphrasing what you wrote in your introduction. For example:</p>

I completely agree with the idea that allowing such people to speak to teenagers about their experiences is the best way to discourage young people from breaking the law.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Someone asked me a useful question: Is there any specific <em><strong>study order</strong></em> that you recommend? So here's what I think:</p>
<p><strong>1. Essay structure and paragraphs</strong></p>
<p>The first thing to do is find an essay structure that works for you. You probably know that I prefer to write 4 paragraphs, and maybe you've seen how I write 2-sentence introductions, 5-sentence main paragraphs and 1-sentence conclusions. <em><strong>Try this:</strong></em> take some essays that you have already written, and rewrite them so that they all have the same number of paragraphs and sentences.</p>
<p><strong>2. Question types</strong></p>
<p>You need to see examples of the <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2012/04/ielts-writing-task-2-question-types.html" target="_self" title="">four question types</a>, and make sure you know how to answer each type using your preferred essay structure.</p>
<p><strong>3. Planning, and isolated paragraph practice</strong></p>
<p>Take several different questions, and practise&nbsp;<a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2015/06/ielts-writing-task-2-from-plan-to-paragraph.html" target="_self" title="">planning</a> ideas. Then spend some time focusing only on introductions e.g. write an introduction for five different questions. Then do the same with conclusions. Then try writing different types of main paragraph e.g. an 'advantages' paragraph, an 'opinion' paragraph, a 'problem' paragraph etc.</p>
<p><strong>4. Topic ideas</strong></p>
<p>When you are confident that you know how to write an essay, it's time to start working through as many <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2011/02/ielts-advice-you-need-ideas-and-opinions.html" target="_self" title="">common IELTS writing topics</a> as possible. Even if you don't write a full essay for each topic, you should at least plan some ideas and opinions.</p>
<p><strong>5. Mistakes, corrections and improvements</strong></p>
<p>Try to find someone who can check your writing, highlight and explain your mistakes, and show you how to improve your essays.</p>

	<p>
				<p>When I was at school I studied French. The teachers taught us lots of grammar, and after five or six years we were ready to learn passives, conditionals and the subjunctive. These were considered to be the the most advanced aspects of the language.</p>
<p>But then I went to France, and realised that I was still a beginner! I couldn't understand fast speech, and I couldn't express myself without thinking first; I needed time to construct sentences in my head.</p>
<p>Now I have a different view about what 'advanced' or 'difficult' language is, and <em><strong>the IELTS marking system agrees with me</strong></em>. An 'advanced' user of English isn't someone who uses lots of passives and conditionals. An advanced user is someone who has a large language <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2011/10/ielts-advice-your-repertoire.html" target="_self" title="">repertoire</a>, can explain ideas in detail, can speak without thinking (too much), and can express the same idea in a variety of ways. Which type of 'advanced' are you tryng to reach?</p>

	<h4><a href="https://www.ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2015/08/ielts-writing-task-2-traditional-views-essay.html">IELTS Writing Task 2: 'traditional views' essay</a></h4>
	<p>
				<p>Here's my full essay for the following question.</p>
<p><em><strong>The older generations tend to have very traditional ideas about how people should live, think and behave. However, some people believe that these ideas are not helpful in preparing younger generations for modern life.</strong></em><br><em><strong>To what extent do you agree or disagree with this view?</strong></em></p>
<p>It is true that many older people believe in traditional values that often seem incompatible with the needs of younger people. While I agree that some traditional ideas are outdated, I believe that others are still useful and should not be forgotten.</p>
<p>On the one hand, many of the ideas that elderly people have about life are becoming less relevant for younger people. In the past, for example, people were advised to learn a profession and find a secure job for life, but today’s workers expect much more variety and diversity from their careers. At the same time, the ‘rules’ around relationships are being eroded as young adults make their own choices about who and when to marry. But perhaps the greatest disparity between the generations can be seen in their attitudes towards gender roles. The traditional roles of men and women, as breadwinners and housewives, are no longer accepted as necessary or appropriate by most younger people.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some traditional views and values are certainly applicable to the modern world. For example, older generations attach great importance to working hard, doing one’s best, and taking pride in one’s work, and these behaviours can surely benefit young people as they enter today’s competitive job market. Other characteristics that are perhaps seen as traditional are politeness and good manners. In our globalised world, young adults can expect to come into contact with people from a huge variety of backgrounds, and it is more important than ever to treat others with respect. Finally, I believe that young people would lead happier lives if they had a more ‘old-fashioned’ sense of community and neighbourliness.</p>
<p>In conclusion, although the views of older people may sometimes seem unhelpful in today’s world, we should not dismiss all traditional ideas as irrelevant.</p>

<p><em>The fact that I wrote about 3 distinct ideas meant that the paragraph "moves forward". Many students seem to get stuck on one idea, and the paragraph has no development or “movement".</em></p>
<p>This is something that I often see in students' essays: they go "round and round" explaining the same idea for a whole paragraph. Look carefully at your own paragraphs to see whether this happens to you. If it does, here are 2 possible solutions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Spend more time planning, and try to think of 3 distinct ideas or points before you start writing. When you've written about one point, leave it and move on to the next one.</li>
<li>Spend more time planning, and develop your idea (if you only have one idea). Make sure you don't just explain the same point in different ways. Instead, try to "move the idea forward" by thinking about reasons, consequences and examples. You could even consider alternatives e.g. what the opposite of your idea would be.</li>

	<p>
				<p>Whenever you see a new word or phrase, it's a good idea to investigate. By this I mean that you should search for the word or phrase online, and see how it is used in a variety of sentences.</p>
<p>For example, take this phrase from yesterday's lesson: <em><strong>"I'm not one for..."</strong></em>. If you search for this phrase on Google, you'll see examples like:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm not one for complaining, but...</li>
<li>I'm not one for writing reviews, but...</li>
<li>I'm not one for settling for mediocrity.</li>
<li>I'm not one for love songs.</li>
<li>I'm not one for celeb news.</li>
<li>I'm not one for too much structure.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think you need to see five or more examples of a new phrase before you start to really see how you could use it yourself. Can you see any 'rules' for the phrase "I'm not one for"? Can you explain what it means? Can you use it in your own sentences?</p>

				<p>If you want to write about both sides of the argument for an "agree or disagree" question, you need to make it clear in your introduction that you "partly agree". For example:</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong><br>The older generations tend to have very traditional ideas about how people should live, think and behave.

				<p>While I don't recommend memorising full IELTS essays, I'm sure that memorising can be a useful technique that might help you to get the score you need.</p>
<p>So, what can you memorise? Here are some ideas:</p>
<ol>
<li>The correct spelling of any words you have problems with.</li>
<li>Some useful organisational phrases e.g. "It is clear that..." (to begin your summary paragraph for writing task 1).</li>
<li>Some common topics for IELTS speaking part 2 e.g. a description of a hobby, person, place.</li>
<li>Some good topic vocabulary (phrases rather than single words) for IELTS writing task 2.</li>
</ol>
<p>Can you think of anything else that you could memorise before the exam?</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here's my full essay for the question that we've been working on recently.</p>
<p><em><strong>Many people prefer to watch foreign films rather than locally produced films. Why could this be?</strong></em><br><em><strong>Should governments give more financial support to local film industries?</strong></em></p>
<p>It is true that foreign films are more popular in many countries than domestically produced films. There could be several reasons why this is the case, and I believe that governments should promote local film-making by subsidising the industry.</p>
<p>There are various reasons why many people find foreign films more enjoyable than the films produced in their own countries. Firstly, the established film industries in certain countries have huge budgets for action, special effects and to shoot scenes in spectacular locations. Hollywood blockbusters like ‘Avatar’ or the James Bond films are examples of such productions, and their global appeal is undeniable. Another reason why these big-budget films are so successful is that they often star the most famous actors and actresses, and they are made by the most accomplished producers and directors. The poor quality, low-budget filmmaking in many countries suffers in comparison.</p>
<p>In my view, governments should support local film industries financially. In every country, there may be talented amateur film-makers who just need to be given the opportunity to prove themselves. To compete with big-budget productions from overseas, these people need money to pay for film crews, actors and a host of other costs related to producing high-quality films. If governments did help with these costs, they would see an increase in employment in the film industry, income from film sales, and perhaps even a rise in tourist numbers. New Zealand, for example, has seen an increase in tourism related to the 'Lord of the Rings' films, which were partly funded by government subsidies.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I believe that increased financial support could help to raise the quality of locally made films and allow them to compete with the foreign productions that currently dominate the market.</p>
<p>(294 words, band 9)</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em><br>I'm not really sure whether the New Zealand example is true, but it's fine to invent this kind of thing in the test!</p>

	<p>
				<p>This week someone asked me a question which included the following statement:</p>
<p><em>Some examiners do not agree with the use of "I" in the writing test.</em></p>
<p>My question is: who are these examiners? I can't believe that examiners would ignore their training and penalise the use of "I". How are candidates expected to answer the question "Do <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you</span> agree or disagree?" without using "I" or "my" (e.g. I completely disagree)? Also, if the personal pronoun "you" is used in the question, why would personal pronouns be prohibited in your answer?</p>
<p>My guess is that this misinformation about the use of "I" is coming from teachers, not examiners. In my experience here in the UK, examiners are all well trained and they all work in the same way. They <em><strong>expect</strong></em> you to use phrases like "I believe" or "I agree" when the question asks for your opinion!</p>

<p>People have differing views with regard to the question of how to make our roads safer. In my view, both punishments and a range of other measures can be used together to promote better driving habits.</p>
<p>On the one hand, strict punishments can certainly help to encourage people to drive more safely. Penalties for dangerous drivers can act as a deterrent, meaning that people avoid repeating the same offence. There are various types of driving penalty, such as small fines, licence suspension, driver awareness courses, and even prison sentences. The aim of these punishments is to show dangerous drivers that their actions have negative consequences. As a result, we would hope that drivers become more disciplined and alert, and that they follow the rules more carefully.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I believe that safe driving can be promoted in several different ways that do not punish drivers. Firstly, it is vitally important to educate people properly before they start to drive, and this could be done in schools or even as part of an extended or more difficult driving test. Secondly, more attention could be paid to safe road design. For example, signs can be used to warn people, speed bumps and road bends can be added to calm traffic, and speed cameras can help to deter people from driving too quickly. Finally, governments or local councils could reduce road accidents by investing in better public transport, which would mean that fewer people would need to travel by car.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while punishments can help to prevent bad driving, I believe that other road safety measures should also be introduced.</p>

	<p>
				<p>At the end of yesterday's speaking lesson, I made an important point:</p>
<p>You need to be <em><strong>conscious</strong></em> of the techniques that you are using as you answer questions in the exam (especially in the speaking and writing tests). Otherwise you'll go back to your 'old technique' of saying or writing whatever comes into your head.</p>
<p>Let me explain this a bit more with an example:</p>
<p>When I teach students the 3-step technique that I mentioned yesterday (answer, explain, example), they have no problem understanding it. However, when I then ask some sample questions, most people seem to forget the technique completely. They miss the example, or they give a list of two or three answers with no explanation.</p>
<p><strong>Ask yourself:</strong> are you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">consciously</span> using the exam techniques that you have learnt, or do you fall back into old habits when under pressure?</p>

	<p>
				<p>Yesterday I explained why nobody can create a list of 'band 9 phrases for any essay'. So, is there any way to prepare band 7-9 vocabulary for the test?</p>
<p>The answer is yes, but I'm afraid you will need to make many lists, not just one! I advise my students to prepare ideas and opinions for as many common IELTS topics as possible. <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2011/02/ielts-advice-you-need-ideas-and-opinions.html" target="_self" title="">Click here</a> to see the basic list that I use.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here's an interesting question that someone asked me on Facebook:</p>
<p><em>Can you add on your blog some typical phrases (band 9) that we can use in every essay?</em></p>
<p>This seems to be the 'secret' that so many people are looking for. The problem is that these phrases <em><strong>do not exist</strong></em>. I'll try to explain why.</p>
<p>To get a high score for vocabulary and task response, you need to use words and phrases that are specific to the particular question that you are given. For example, if the question is about the environment, you could write about 'greenhouse gases' or 'carbon dioxide emissions'. But these phrases cannot be used in every essay; they are only relevant to this one topic.</p>
<p>The only phrases that can be used in every essay would be 'linking' phrases, and these do not contribute to your vocabulary or task response scores. They only help you to organise your ideas.</p>
<p>So, please stop looking for 'any essay' phrases. Tomorrow I'll explain what to do instead.</p>

	<h4><a href="https://www.ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2015/04/ielts-advice-score-fluctuations.html">IELTS Advice: score fluctuations</a></h4>
	<p>
				<p>Yesterday I explained why it's normal for your scores to fluctuate between tests. Now I'm going to try to suggest some ways to deal with this.</p>
<p><strong>1. Keep retaking the test</strong></p>
<p>This advice might surprise you, but I remember a student who booked 4 tests in one month. He understood that his scores would fluctuate, but he hoped to improve his chances of having a 'lucky day' when everything went well. It worked! The student told me that the main benefit of taking the test every week was that he stopped feeling nervous. On the third Saturday he performed well in all 4 parts of the test and achieved the scores he needed. <em>*But read the warning below!</em></p>
<p><strong>2. Practise until you over-perform</strong></p>
<p>To get a band 7 in exam conditions, you probably need to be achieving band 7.5 when practising at home. Most people perform worse in real tests due to nerves, so make sure you can comfortably get the score you need before taking the test.</p>
<p><strong>3. Be more consistent in your approach</strong></p>
<p>You might think that you always write essays in the same way, but most people don't. One of my aims in these lessons is to encourage people to use the exact same method every time. For example, I always try to write&nbsp;<a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2015/02/ielts-writing-task-1-9-sentences.html" target="_self" title="">9 sentences</a> for writing task 1, and&nbsp;<a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2015/02/ielts-writing-task-2-13-sentences.html" target="_self" title="">13 sentences</a> for task 2. If you can't say how many sentences you usually write, you're probably not being consistent. I'm using writing as an example, but there are methods for the other parts too.</p>
<p><em><strong>Notes:</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>*<em>Warning</em>: Strategy number 1 can be expensive, and there are no guarantees that it will work. Only try this if you are able to get the score you need in each part and you keep missing your target by 0.5 band in just one part of the test.</li>
<li>Strategy&nbsp;number 2 is sensible, but some people don't want to wait until they can over-perfom.</li>
<li>Strategy&nbsp;number 3 is my favourite. If I can help students to become more consistent, I feel like I'm doing my job as a teacher!</li>

	<p>
				<p>People often wonder why their IELTS scores fluctuate. For example, they might get a band 7 in writing one week, but only band 6 or 6.5 the next week.</p>
<p>Does this mean that the test is unreliable or that you had a bad examiner?</p>
<p>Probably not. Fluctuations are normal, both in the exam and when you are practising at home. For example, I've seen the same fluctuations in the quality of students' homework. Sometimes they have great ideas for the essay topic, or they find the answers easily in a reading test. Other times everything seems to go wrong; they have a bad day, and get lower scores.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I'll talk a bit more about this, and I'll try to suggest some strategies for dealing with this 'fluctuation' problem.</p>

	<p>
				<p>People sometimes ask me whether writing a longer introduction could be the way to improve their task 2 scores. My answer is no! A longer introduction is more likely to harm your score, not help it. The more time you spend on your introduction, the less time you have to write good main body paragraphs. The main body is the key to a high score!</p>
<p>So, how can we improve our main body paragraphs? I think there are 3 easy steps you can take:</p>
<ol>

	<p>
				<p><em><strong>These days more fathers stay at home and take care of their children while mothers go out to work. What could be the reasons for this? Do you think it is a positive or a negative development?</strong></em></p>
<p>It is true that men are increasingly likely to take on the role of househusband, while more women than ever are the breadwinners in their families. There could be several reasons for this, and I consider it to be a very positive trend.</p>
<p>In recent years, parents have had to adapt to various changes in our societies. Equal rights movements have made great progress, and it has become normal for women to gain qualifications and pursue a career. It has also become socially acceptable for men to stay at home and look after their children. At the same time, the rising cost of living has meant that both marriage partners usually need to work and save money before starting a family. Therefore, when couples have children, they may decide who works and who stays at home depending on the personal preference of each partner, or based on which partner earns the most money.</p>
<p>In my view, the changes described above should be seen as progress. We should be happy to live in a society in which men and women have equal opportunities, and in which women are not put under pressure to sacrifice their careers. Equally, it seems only fair that men should be free to leave their jobs in order to assume childcare responsibilities if this is what they wish to do. Couples should be left to make their own decisions about which parental role each partner takes, according to their particular circumstances and needs.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the changing roles of men and women in the family are a result of wider changes in society, and I believe that these developments are desirable.</p>

	<p>
				<p>How do you know when you're ready to take the IELTS exam? Here's my advice:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you've never taken the exam before, take it as soon as you can. You'll be surprised how difficult a full day of testing is! Treat your first attempt as a practice test to get used to what it 'feels' like. Also, taking the exam is the best way to assess your level.</li>
<li>Your next step could be to read about the best ways (techniques, methods) of doing each part of the exam; this is what I try to provide here on the website. Read my advice, analyse my model answers, and try to copy the way I approach each part of the test.</li>
<li>Using what you have learnt, you need to practise and train yourself. This is not the same as testing yourself. Read <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2015/03/ielts-advice-testing-or-training.html" target="_self" title="">yesterday's lesson</a> to understand the difference.</li>
<li>Finally, you need to do some tests and get feedback. You need to find out what you are doing wrong and what you need to do to improve. The best form of feedback is from a teacher who can read your essays or listen to you speak.</li>
</ol>
<p>You will know that you are ready when you consistently get the score you need in all of your practice tests.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Many students prepare for the IELTS exam by doing lots of practice tests. But too much testing is a bad idea.</p>
<p>I think that there is a difference between 'testing' and 'training'.</p>
<p><strong>Testing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>shows you what your current level is</li>
<li>gets you used to working in exam conditions (e.g. with a time limit)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>means that you focus on vocabulary for a particular topic</li>
<li>or work on particular grammar mistakes</li>
<li>or work on a technique for a particular part of the exam</li>
</ul>
<p>A good example of training is when you practise writing introductions. Sometimes I spend a whole lesson with my students just doing different introductions. We practise one technique until students become good at it.</p>
<p>So, how much 'training' and how much 'testing' should you do? Well, a good idea might be to spend Monday to Friday training, preparing and working on language. Then test yourself at the weekend - if you've worked hard, you might see an improvement!</p>

<p><em>1) These days more fathers stay at home and take care of their children while mothers go out to work. What could be the reasons for this? Do you think it is a positive or a negative development?</em></p>
<p><em>2) Some people believe that children should be allowed to stay at home and play until they are six or seven years old. Others believe that it is important for young children to go to school as soon as possible. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.</em></p>
<p><em>3) Some people think that mothers should spend most of their time raising their children, and therefore the government should support them financially. Do you agree or disagree?</em></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Personally, I would start with task 1.</strong></p>
<p>You'll be feeling nervous in the exam, so it's a good idea to start with something easy: the introduction to task 1.

<p>So, don't waste any time at the beginning of the writing test. If you have practised paraphrasing task 1 questions, you should be confident that you know exactly what to do. Get started straight away; you'll feel much better.</p>

				<p>A student asked me the following question:</p>

<p>Here's my answer:</p>
<p>Quality is more important than quantity in the IELTS writing test. If you write a longer essay, you <em><strong>might</strong></em> demonstrate a wider range of vocabulary. On the other hand, you might just repeat the same ideas, and you might make more mistakes.</p>
<p>I don't teach my students to write longer essays (anything over 250 words is fine). I teach them to spend 10 minutes planning good ideas, rather than trying to write more words. In my view, planning is the secret to improving the quality.</p>

Now let's look at what was missing: the detailed explanation of ideas in the main body paragraphs. I'm tempted to refer to this as the 'muscle' on top of the skeleton's bones!</p>
<p><strong>Here's an example of a full paragraph:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: #0000ff;">(1)</span> On the other hand, school teachers may contribute almost as much as parents to the development of a child. <span style="font-size: 8pt; color: #0000ff;">(2)</span> Teachers educate large groups of children together, which means that they must train pupils to work with their peers and respect other members of the class. <span style="color: #0000ff; font-size: 8pt;">(3)</span> Pupils also learn to behave sensibly in lessons, regardless of the distractions around them, and to follow instructions given to them by teaching staff. <span style="color: #0000ff; font-size: 8pt;">(4)</span> These behavioural skills will be crucial in later life. <span style="color: #0000ff; font-size: 8pt;">(5)</span> In the workplace, for example, adults are expected to work in teams, listen to each other, and follow the instructions of a manager or company director.</p>
<p><strong>Notice how I "build" the paragraph using 5 sentences:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Topic sentence introducing the main idea - the role of teachers in children's development.</li>
<li>One aspect of this role - training children to work with others.</li>
<li>Another aspect of this role - children learn to behave and follow instructions.</li>
<li>Why the two points above are important - for later life.</li>
<li>Examples - work in teams, follow a manager's instructions.</li>

				<p>For me, the skeleton (or framework or basic structure) of a task 2 essay is:</p>
<p>- the introduction<br>- topic sentences for main paragraphs<br>- and the conclusion</p>
<p>Look at this essay 'skeleton' for example:</p>
<p>..........</p>
<p><em>People have different views about whether parents or schools should bear the responsibility for helping children to become good citizens. In my view, this responsibility should be shared.</em></p>
<p><em>On the one hand, parents certainly have a vital role to play in the upbringing of their children.</em></p>
<p><em>On the other hand, school teachers may contribute almost as much as parents to the development of a child.</em></p>
<p><em>In conclusion, both parents and schools should work together to ensure that young people become polite and productive members of society.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Topic vocabulary</strong></em> is the term I use when I'm teaching IELTS writing task 2. It refers to single words, collocations and phrases that relate specifically to the question topic. So, "global warming" is topic vocabulary, but "for example" isn't. </p>

				<p>A student asked me which sentence I prefer from these two:</p>
<ol>
<li>There is an array of reasons for the proliferation of high amounts of waste disposal.</li>
<li>There are various reasons for the rise in the amount of waste that we produce.</li>
</ol>
<p>Although sentence 1 might look more 'difficult' (due to the use of <em>array</em>, <em>proliferation</em> and <em>disposal</em>), I definitely prefer sentence 2.</p>
<p>The problem with sentence 1 is that it seems forced and unnatural:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Array of reasons" is fine, although no better than "various reasons".</li>
<li>"Proliferation" and "high amounts" sound strange together. I would use one or the other, but not both.</li>
<li>"The proliferation of waste disposal" also sounds wrong to a native speaker. It isn't a collocation that I would expect to read or hear.</li>
<li>I think the topic would be about "waste production", not "waste disposal". The root problem is that we are producing more waste, not that we are throwing it away more often. The word "disposal" looks good, but for me it affects the coherence of the sentence.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think this is a great example of what I said in Wednesday's <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2015/01/ielts-writing-task-2-the-confidence-to-be-simple.html" target="_self" title="">lesson</a> about having the confidence to keep it simple.

	<p>
				<p>A student, Kishanth, asked me about two of the points in the grammar criterion for band 8 writing (both task 1 and 2):</p>
<ul>
<li>uses a wide range of structures</li>
<li>the majority of sentences are error-free</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Here's the problem with these two points:</strong><br>When you try to use a wide range of grammatical structures, you risk making more mistakes (errors). But to reduce the number of mistakes, you might have to simplify your sentences.</p>
<p><strong>So what should you do?</strong><br>My advice is this: Forget about the 'wide range of structures' point. If all of your focus is on using complex grammar, you'll probably do something worse than just make mistakes; you'll probably forget to answer the question properly. The people who worry most about grammar usually neglect <em>task response</em>, <em>coherence</em> and <em>vocabulary</em>.</p>
<p>For me, grammar is the least important criterion to worry about. I tell students to focus on the other 75% of the scoring system: task response, coherence and vocabulary. However, if you want my tip for improving your grammar score, I'd say that it's better to focus on reducing errors. I think examiners notice errors more than they notice grammatical range, and if you write a mix of short and long sentences, you'll probably fulfil the 'wide range of structures' requirement without realising it.</p>

<p>Some people argue that it is pointless to spend money on the protection of wild animals because we humans have no need for them. I completely disagree with this point of view.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0060bf;">In my opinion, it is absurd to argue that wild animals have no place in the 21st century.</span> I do not believe that planet Earth exists only for the benefit of humans, and there is nothing special about this particular century that means that we suddenly have the right to allow or encourage the extinction of any species. Furthermore, there is no compelling reason why we should let animals die out. We do not need to exploit or destroy every last square metre of land in order to feed or accommodate the world’s population. There is plenty of room for us to exist side by side with wild animals, and this should be our aim.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0060bf;">I also disagree with the idea that protecting animals is a waste of resources.</span> It is usually the protection of natural habitats that ensures the survival of wild animals, and most scientists agree that these habitats are also crucial for human survival. For example, rainforests produce oxygen, absorb carbon dioxide and stabilise the Earth’s climate. If we destroyed these areas, the costs of managing the resulting changes to our planet would far outweigh the costs of conservation. By protecting wild animals and their habitats, we maintain the natural balance of all life on Earth.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have no right to decide whether or not wild animals should exist, and I believe that we should do everything we can to protect them.</p>

<p><em><strong>Wild animals have no place in the 21st century, so protecting them is a waste of resources. To what extent do you agree or disagree?</strong></em></p>
<p>The first step is to decide whether we agree, disagree or partly agree. My preference would be to 'completely disagree'. I don't think we can partly agree in this case (either we value and protect animals or we don't).</p>
<p>Next, we need a 4-paragraph plan:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Introduce</strong> the topic (rights and protection of wild animals), then answer the question (completely disagree)</li>
<li><strong>First reason</strong> why we disagree e.g. our duty to protect animals, their rights and place in the world</li>

				<p>As I said <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2014/12/ielts-speaking-part-1-parks-answers.html" target="_self" title="">yesterday</a>, you don't need to 'show off' in part 1 of IELTS speaking. However, I did use some nice vocabulary in my answers:</p>
<p>- every city needs some green space<br>- people can escape from the crowds<br>- Parks are like an oasis<br>- get away from the hustle and bustle* of city life<br>- take some exercise<br>- forget about work for a while<br>- I can't imagine what I would do</p>
<p>*hustle and bustle = busy activity, usually when describing a city</p>

	<h4><a href="https://www.ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2014/12/ielts-writing-task-2-agree-disagree-or-partly-agree.html">IELTS Writing Task 2: agree, disagree or partly agree?</a></h4>
	<p>
				<p>Here's some advice for people who are still confused about "agree or disagree" questions:</p>
<p><strong>If you completely agree or completely disagree:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Make your opinion clear in the introduction and conclusion.</li>
<li>Explain one reason for your opinion in paragraph 2 and another in paragraph 3. Imagine that you are persuading the examiner that your opinion is right.</li>
<li><em><strong>Don't</strong></em> write a paragraph about what 'other people' think. If you do that, you are in danger of writing a "discuss both views" essay. If you mention the opposite argument, make sure that you refute it (explain why you think it's wrong), like I did in paragraph 2 of <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2013/12/ielts-writing-task-2-foreign-tourists-essay.html" target="_self" title="">this essay</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you partly agree:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Make it clear in the introduction and conclusion that you have a balanced view i.e. that you accept both sides of the argument to some extent, like I did in last week's <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2014/12/ielts-writing-task-2-balanced-opinion.html" target="_self" title="">lesson</a>.</li>
<li>Write one paragraph about each side of the argument. But do this from <span style="text-decoration: underline;">your</span> point of view e.g. On the one hand, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I accept</span> that... / On the other hand, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I also believe</span> that...</li>
<li><em><strong>Don't</strong></em> write a discussion essay e.g. some people believe / other people argue...</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>PS.</strong> This week's (free) video lesson will also help with this "agree, disagree or partly agree" problem. It will be ready tomorrow.</p>

				<p>In <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2011/09/ielts-writing-task-2-balanced-opinion.html" target="_self" title="">this lesson</a> I suggested writing a balanced opinion (partly agree) essay for the question below.</p>
<p><em><strong>In the last century, the first man to walk on the moon said it was "a giant leap for mankind”. However, some people think it has made little difference to our daily lives. </strong></em><em><strong>To what extent do you agree or disagree?</strong></em></p>
<p>You can see my 4-paragraph plan in the lesson, but a student asked me to explain exactly how we can 'partly agree'. So here's my sample introduction:</p>
<p><em>It is often argued that the act of sending a man to the moon has been of no benefit to normal people. While I agree that this is true in <strong>practical</strong> terms, I believe that the <strong>psychological</strong> impact of this great achievement should not be underestimated.</em></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong><br>Can you see how I create a balanced answer by using a 'while' sentence to contrast the 'practical' and 'psychological' impacts of the moon landing?</p>

	<p>
				<p>If you're using my <em><strong>4-paragraph essay</strong></em> approach, your essays only need to contain two main ideas - one for each main body paragraph.</p>
<p>But there is a difference between the <em><strong>main idea</strong></em>&nbsp;and the <em><strong>supporting points</strong></em>. For example, the main idea could be "there are several advantages", and each advantage is a supporting point. Start a new paragraph for each main idea, but not for each supporting point.</p>
<p>Express your main idea for each paragraph in a 'topic sentence' at the beginning of the paragraph. Then explain that idea with either one, two or three supporting points.</p>

	<p>
				<p>In <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2014/11/ielts-writing-task-2-which-part-to-answer.html" target="_self" title="">last week's lesson</a> I gave you two exam questions and asked you to think about which part of each question you should answer.</p>
<p>I hope you realised that we need to write about <em><strong>both</strong></em> parts (the green and blue parts). Let's look again at the questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Wild animals have no place in the 21st century, so protecting them is a waste of resources. To what extent do you agree or disagree?</li>
<li>International travel is cheaper than ever before, and more countries have opened their doors to tourists. Do the advantages of this trend outweigh the disadvantages?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Question 1 contains two opinions:</strong> "wild animals have no place in the 21st century" and "protecting them is a waste of resources". These two opinions are connected, and we need to address both of them in our answer. A good way to do this might be to disagree completely, and to write one main body paragraph for each opinion (explaining why you disagree).</p>
<p><strong>Question 2 contains two facts:</strong> "international travel is cheaper than ever before" and "more countries have opened their doors to tourists". The 'trend' in the question refers to both of these facts, and we need to consider the advantages and disadvantages of both aspects of this trend.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em><br>Some questions do contain a 'background' statement that you can quickly accept in your introduction (e.g. <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2014/09/ielts-writing-task-2-happiness-essay.html" target="_self" title="">this one</a>). If you're unsure, just answer all parts of the question.</p>

<p>A student, Raymond, asked which part of this question we should answer. Should we agree or disagree with just the blue part, just the green part, or both parts?</p>
<p>Here's another example:</p>
<p><em><strong><span style="color: #0060bf;">International travel is cheaper than ever before</span>, and <span style="color: #438059;">more countries have opened their doors to tourists</span>. Do the advantages of this trend outweigh the disadvantages?</strong></em></p>
<p>For this question, Raymond asks whether we need to discuss the pros and cons of travel being cheaper, or whether we should just focus on the green part. What do you think?</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><strong><em>Note: </em></strong>You can find my answer and explanation in <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2014/11/ielts-writing-task-2-which-part-to-answer-1.html" target="_self" title="">this lesson</a>.</span></p>

<p>This kind of worrying is a waste of time and energy. My advice is that you should only worry about 2 things in the speaking test: 1) listening carefully to the questions 2) trying your best to give good answers. It's a language exam, so let's worry about language.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here are the 5 ideas from last week, about the negatives of credit cards:</p>
<p>1. encourage spending money that people don't have<br>2. leads to excess shopping, consumer culture<br>3. more credit cards, debt becomes out of control<br>4. bankrupt, in court, lose home<br>5. sometimes fines or even prison</p>
<p>Now here's a 5-sentence paragraph using these ideas:</p>
<p>The main drawback of credit cards is that they encourage people to spend money that they do not have. This has led to the consumer culture and addiction to shopping that we now see in society. When credit card users are unable to pay off their debts, they often resort to signing up for multiple cards, and the debt becomes increasingly overwhelming. Many people in this situation find themselves in court, bankrupt, and without a home as a final consequence of credit card dependence. In the worst cases, they may even face prison sentences.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em><br>Notice that I made one or two changes (e.g. 'overwhelming' instead of 'out of control'), but that I mostly followed the plan, writing one sentence for each idea. Practise doing this yourself.</p>

				<p>Have you tried using Google (or another search engine) to resolve grammar problems?

<p>If we put quotation marks ("...") around the key words, and Google them, we can look for patterns in the search results that help us to understand the grammar.</p>
<p><em><strong>Example:</strong></em><br>Try searching for "preconditions to achieving", then try "preconditions to being" and "preconditions to doing". The search results should show you that "preconditions to +ing" is a normal grammar pattern in English.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here's my full essay for the question below.</p>
<p><em><strong>Happiness is considered very important in life.</strong></em><br><em><strong>Why is it difficult to define?</strong></em><br><em><strong>What factors are important in achieving happiness?</strong></em></p>
<p>It is no doubt true that the majority of people would like to be happy in their lives. While the personal nature of happiness makes it difficult to describe, there do seem to be some common needs that we all share with regard to experiencing or achieving happiness.</p>
<p>Happiness is difficult to define because it means something different to each individual person. Nobody can fully understand or experience another person’s feelings, and we all have our own particular passions from which we take pleasure. Some people, for example, derive a sense of satisfaction from earning money or achieving success, whereas for others, health and family are much more important. At the same time, a range of other feelings, from excitement to peacefulness, may be associated with the idea of happiness, and the same person may therefore feel happy in a variety of different ways.</p>
<p>Although it seems almost impossible to give a precise definition of happiness, most people would agree that there are some basic preconditions to achieving it. Firstly, it is hard for a person to be happy if he or she does not have a safe place to live and enough food to eat. Our basic survival needs must surely be met before we can lead a pleasant life. Secondly, the greatest joy in life is usually found in shared experiences with family and friends, and it is rare to find a person who is content to live in complete isolation. Other key factors could be individual freedom and a sense of purpose in life.</p>
<p>In conclusion, happiness is difficult to define because it is particular to each individual, but I believe that our basic needs for shelter, food and company need to be fulfilled before we can experience it.</p>

				<p>Most students use a dictionary to find the meanings of words. However, this is not enough; you also need to know how to use words correctly or accurately.</p>
<p>For example, you might know the meaning of the word "blame", but do you know which preposition follows it? Do you know that it can be a verb or a noun? Do you know which verbs can be used with the noun "the blame"?</p>
<ul>
<li>Many people <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">blame</span> politicians <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">for</span> the economic crisis. (verb)</li>
<li>Politicians have <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">taken the blame for</span> the economic crisis. (take + noun)</li>
<li>Other people <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">put the blame for</span> this problem <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">on</span> the banks. (put + noun)</li>
<li>They think the banks <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">are to blame for</span> the crisis. (phrase: is/are to blame)</li>

<li>Happiness means different things to different people.</li>
<li>It can be described as a feeling of pleasure or enjoyment.</li>
<li>People enjoy spending time with family and friends.</li>
<li>Hobbies, sports and games can be a source of fun and enjoyment.</li>
<li>Some people see money as a source of happiness.</li>
<li>Other people define happiness as something deeper.</li>
<li>They need to feel that they are doing something useful with their lives.</li>
<li>Some people get a sense of achievement from their work.</li>

				<p>To get a high vocabulary score, you should try to use a good <em><strong>range</strong></em> of vocabulary. However, this <span style="text-decoration: underline;">doesn't</span> mean that 'strange' or 'difficult' words are the secret to success.</p>
<p>The vocabulary that you use also needs to be <em><strong>natural</strong></em> and <em><strong>appropriate</strong></em> to the style of the essay or report that you are writing. This is the reason why I suggested avoiding words like 'plummet' and 'rocket' in writing task 1.

<p>But someone asked this sensible question:</p>
<p><em>How can we get a high score for lexical resource (vocabulary) if we only use common words like 'increase', 'rise' and 'fall'?</em></p>
<p>The quick answer is that it's better to use 'less common vocabulary' for other aspects of your description.

				<p>Let's go back to the question we were looking at a couple of weeks ago:</p>
<p><em><strong>In some parts of the world it is becoming popular to research the history of one's own family. Why might people want to do this? Is it a positive or negative development?</strong></em></p>
<p>Here's the plan I wrote for the first main body paragraph:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Paragraph 2: Why might people want to research family history?</li>
<li>various different reasons</li>
<li>to know more about themselves and their roots, where they come from, whether their ancestors had similar personality traits</li>
<li>because the Internet makes it easier to do this research, we hear about others who have done it, there are advertisements to encourage us</li>
<li>out of curiosity e.g. we might secretly hope that we have a famous or wealthy ancestor</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's a full paragraph using the ideas above:</p>
<p>There are various reasons why people might decide to trace their family histories. One explanation may be that they would like to know more about themselves, in terms of their roots, where they come from, or whether their ancestors had similar personality traits. Another factor could be that it has become so much easier to carry out genealogical research using the Internet. We hear about people who have studied their family trees, and there are even advertisements to encourage us to use genealogy websites. Finally, it may be that people are simply curious to find out whether they have any famous or wealthy ancestors.</p>

<li>where I grew up</li>
<li>the marriage ceremony was held in a church</li>
<li>the wedding reception</li>
<li>members of my family</li>
<li>the bride and groom</li>
<li>my mother made sure that...</li>
<li>we all dressed for the occasion</li>
<li>and so on (instead of "etc.")</li>
<li>her big day</li>

	<p>
				<p>Here's an essay that I wrote with my students using the ideas and the advice about organisation in last week's <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2014/06/ielts-writing-task-2-brainstorm-then-organise.html" target="_self" title="">lesson</a>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Families who send their children to private schools should not be required to pay taxes that support the state education system.</strong></em><br><em><strong>To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?</strong></em></p>
<p>Some people believe that parents of children who attend private schools should not need to contribute to state schools through taxes. Personally, I completely disagree with this view.</p>
<p>For a variety of reasons, it would be wrong to reduce taxes for families who pay for private education. Firstly, it would be difficult to calculate the correct amount of tax reduction for these families, and staff would be required to manage this complex process. Secondly, we all pay a certain amount of tax for public services that we may not use. For example, most people are fortunate enough not to have to call the police or fire brigade at any time in their lives, but they would not expect a tax reduction for this. Finally, if wealthy families were given a tax discount for sending their children to private schools, we might have a situation where poorer people pay higher taxes than the rich.</p>
<p>In my opinion, we should all be happy to pay our share of the money that supports public schools. It is beneficial for all members of society to have a high quality education system with equal opportunities for all young people. This will result in a well-educated workforce, and in turn a more productive and prosperous nation. Parents of children in private schools may also see the advantages of this in their own lives. For example, a company owner will need well qualified and competent staff, and a well-funded education system can provide such employees.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I do not believe that any financial concessions should be made for people who choose private education.</p>

	<p>
				<p>I asked my students to brainstorm ideas for the question below.</p>
<p><em><strong>Families who send their children to private schools should not be required to pay taxes that support the state education system.</strong></em><br><em><strong>To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?</strong></em></p>
<p>Here are their ideas for a 'completely disagree' answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>difficult to calculate the tax reduction</li>
<li>more government staff would be required for this process</li>
<li>we all pay for public services that we may not need e.g. police</li>
<li>poorer people would pay more tax than wealthy people</li>
<li>state schools benefit the whole of society</li>
<li>high quality state education leads to equal opportunities for all</li>
<li>a well-educated workforce is the key to a prosperous nation</li>
<li>companies need educated staff</li>
<li>we should all be happy to contribute to public services</li>
</ul>
<p>After brainstorming, we need to organise these ideas so that we have two paragraphs. There seem to be two main themes in the ideas above:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reasons why we think the idea would not work, or would be unfair.</li>
<li>Reasons why everyone should pay taxes that support state education.</li>
</ol>
<p>Next week I'll show you how we used these ideas to write a full essay.</p>

<li>Work on your exam technique</li>
<li>Work on your English</li>

<p>I can often help students to make fast improvements by teaching them how to organise their essays, how to look for keywords in the reading test, or how to expand their answers in the speaking test. These are exam techniques.</p>
<p>However, exam techniques alone will not get you a band 7. You need a good level of English to get a 7, and that means you need to do the hard work it takes to gradually learn more words and phrases, improve your speaking fluency, and generally become a more confident user of the language.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em><br>Point 2 takes time. Don't expect your English to improve from 5.5 to 7 without a lot of work!</p>

<p><em><strong>Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements, and this sets a bad example to young people.</strong></em><br><em><strong>To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?</strong></em></p>
<p>It is true that some celebrities are known for their glamorous lifestyles rather than for the work they do. While I agree that these celebrities set a bad example for children, I believe that other famous people act as positive role models.</p>
<p>On the one hand, many people do achieve fame without really working for it. They may have inherited money from parents, married a famous or wealthy person, or they may have appeared in gossip magazines or on a reality TV programme. A good example would be Paris Hilton, who is rich and famous for the wrong reasons. She spends her time attending parties and nightclubs, and her behaviour promotes the idea that appearance, glamour and media profile are more important than hard work and good character. The message to young people is that success can be achieved easily, and that school work is not necessary.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are at least as many celebrities whose accomplishments make them excellent role models for young people. Actors, musicians and sports stars become famous idols because they have worked hard and applied themselves to develop real skills and abilities. They demonstrate great effort, determination and ambition, which is required for someone who wants to be truly successful in their chosen field. An example is the actor and martial artist Jackie Chan, who has become world famous through years of practice and hard work. This kind of self-made celebrity can inspire children to develop their talents through application and perseverance.</p>

<p>- How many hours of study do you do each day?<br>- What kind of study do you do?<br>- Do you have a teacher or someone who can help you?<br>- Do you live in an English-speaking country?<br>- Do you like learning English, or do you just need an IELTS score?</p>

	<p>
				<p>Can you write an error-free sentence? How about an error-free paragraph?</p>
<p>If you want to get a band 7 or higher for IELTS writing, the examiner needs to see that you "regularly write error-free sentences". This means that several of the sentences in your essays should contain <em><strong>no</strong></em> mistakes.</p>
<p>The best way to improve your grammatical accuracy is by learning from your mistakes. Try to find a teacher or native speaker who can check your work and highlight the errors. Then make sure you understand the mistakes you made, and try to avoid making them again. Aim to write more error-free sentences each time you write an essay.</p>

	<p>
				<p>A 'role model' is a person who acts as an example to others. The following is a recent IELTS exam question about this topic.</p>
<p><em><strong>Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements, and this sets a bad example to young people.</strong></em><br><em><strong>To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?</strong></em></p>
<p>Here are some tips to help you plan your answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start by considering some real examples. Think about the celebrities you know - are they famous for their glamour and wealth, or for their achievements?</li>
<li>It's usually easier to write about both sides. Think about whether it's possible to 'partly agree', or to have a strong opinion but still mention the other view.</li>
<li>Plan for a 4-paragraph essay. Decide what your view is, then focus on the main body paragraphs - what will be the central idea in each one?</li>

	<p>
				<p><em><strong>When choosing a job, the salary is the most important consideration. To what extent do you agree or disagree?</strong></em></p>
<p>Many people choose their jobs based on the size of the salary offered. Personally, I disagree with the idea that money is the key consideration when deciding on a career, because I believe that other factors are equally important.</p>
<p>On the one hand, I agree that money is necessary in order for people to meet their basic needs. For example, we all need money to pay for housing, food, bills, health care, and education. Most people consider it a priority to at least earn a salary that allows them to cover these needs and have a reasonable quality of life. If people chose their jobs based on enjoyment or other non-financial factors, they might find it difficult to support themselves. Artists and musicians, for instance, are known for choosing a career path that they love, but that does not always provide them with enough money to live comfortably and raise a family.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I believe that other considerations are just as important as what we earn in our jobs. Firstly, personal relationships and the atmosphere in a workplace are extremely important when choosing a job. Having a good manager or friendly colleagues, for example, can make a huge difference to workers’ levels of happiness and general quality of life. Secondly, many people’s feelings of job satisfaction come from their professional achievements, the skills they learn, and the position they reach, rather than the money they earn. Finally, some people choose a career because they want to help others and contribute something positive to society.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while salaries certainly affect people’s choice of profession, I do not believe that money outweighs all other motivators.</p>

				<p>Sometimes, the best way to think of ideas for an essay is to start with an example. One good example can give you enough ideas for a full paragraph.</p>

<p>Look at the following question:</p>

<p><em><strong>Should governments make decisions about people's lifestyle, or should people make their own decisions?</strong></em></p>

<p>This question seems difficult, but if you take "smoking" as an example of a lifestyle choice, it becomes a lot easier. Here's my paragraph:</p>

<p>In some cases, governments can help people to make better lifestyle choices. In the UK, for example, smoking is now banned in all workplaces, and it is even prohibited for people to smoke in restaurants, bars and pubs. As a result, many people who used to smoke socially have now given up. At the same time, the government has ensured that cigarette prices keep going up, and there have been several campaigns to highlight the health risks of smoking. These measures have also helped to reduce the number of smokers in this country.</p>

	<p>
				<p><em><strong>Some people think that in the modern world we are more dependent on each other, while others think that people have become more independent.  Discuss both views and give your own opinion.</strong></em></p>
<p>People have different views about whether we are more or less dependent on others nowadays. In my view, modern life forces us to be more independent than people were in the past.</p>
<p>There are two main reasons why it could be argued that we are more dependent on each other now. Firstly, life is more complex and difficult, especially because the cost of living has increased so dramatically. For example, young adults tend to rely on their parents for help when buying a house. Property prices are higher than ever, and without help it would be impossible for many people to pay a deposit and a mortgage. Secondly, people seem to be more ambitious nowadays, and they want a better quality of life for their families. This means that both parents usually need to work full-time, and they depend on support from grandparents and babysitters for child care.</p>
<p>However, I would agree with those who believe that people are more independent these days. In most countries, families are becoming smaller and more dispersed, which means that people cannot count on relatives as much as they used to. We also have more freedom to travel and live far away from our home towns. For example, many students choose to study abroad instead of going to their local university, and this experience makes them more independent as they learn to live alone. Another factor in this growing independence is technology, which allows us to work alone and from any part of the world.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while there are some reasons to believe that people now depend on each other more, my own view is that we are more independent than ever.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em><br>As usual, try to analyse this essay in terms of task response (does it fully answer the question?), organisation, 'band 7-9' vocabulary, and grammar.</p>

<p>Three main factors are affecting health in modern societies. One problem is the lack of awareness among many people of the negative consequences of an unhealthy diet. This is made worse by the prevalence of fast food and processed food, which are full of fat, salt and sugar. Another key factor is the changing trend in lifestyles. For example, children’s hobbies now involve much less outdoor activity, and adults are less active as jobs have shifted towards sedentary office work instead of manual labour. In addition to this, time-saving technologies, such as cars, elevators, dishwashers and washing machines, have made people lazier.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Several people have asked me for help with the question below.</p>
<p><em><strong>Nowadays it is easy to apply for and be given a credit card. However, some people experience problems when they are not be able to pay their debts back. In your opinion, do the advantages of credit cards outweigh the disadvantages?</strong></em></p>
<p>You might be surprised to see a question about credit cards, but I don't think it's as bad as it seems. Let's summarise the advantages and disadvantages:</p>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong><br>A credit card gives you access to money and the facility to pay it back later, like a loan. This could be useful for emergencies or something expensive, like a holiday. Credit cards are a safe way to pay. Easy access to money means that people spend, and this benefits the economy.</p>
<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong><br>Credit cards encourage people to spend money they do not have. Debts can build up and leave people in real financial difficulties. When people cannot pay their debts back, everyone suffers: those in debt may lose their homes, the banks lose money, and the whole economy suffers.</p>
<p><em><strong>Task:</strong></em> Try using these ideas to write full paragraphs.</p>

<p>Have you made note of all the vocabulary in this week's lessons here on the site? Look closely at the lessons and you'll find a lot of useful language. Write it down in your notebook, and try using it.</p>

	<p>
				<p>A few days ago, I looked at the question in <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2010/12/ielts-writing-task-2-money-and-consumerism.html" target="_self" title="">this lesson</a> with my students here in Manchester. The phrase 'consumer society' is a negative one because it suggests that our lives revolve around money and possessions.</p>
<p><strong>Here's part of an essay that my students helped me to write:</strong></p>
<p>It is true that many people criticize modern society because it seems to be too materialistic. I agree with this to some extent, but I do not think it is the case that everyone is a victim of consumer culture.</p>
<p>On the one hand, many people do seem to focus too much on money and possessions. Wherever we go, we are bombarded with advertising to sell us products and services, many of which we do not need. For example, people may be persuaded to purchase the latest model of iPhone, when their old phone is still perfectly functional. This could be seen as a demonstration that we are obsessive consumers; we buy things based on fashion and branding, and shopping has become a hobby or even an addiction.</p>

				<p>Last week I made a video lesson to show you how I would do an essay plan. Today I want to show you how I turned part of that plan into a full paragraph.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Paragraph topic:</strong> The most important element of a perfect society.</li>
<li><strong>Planned ideas:</strong> Safety = No crime, trust our neighbours, feel part of a community, able to leave doors unlocked. Trust institutions (police, government), feel protected by the law. Safety is the most basic freedom.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Here's my paragraph using the ideas above:</strong></p>
<p>If I had to choose the one, most desirable element of an ideal society, it would have to be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">safety</span>. A safe society would be one in which <span style="text-decoration: underline;">crime did not exist</span>, and in which all citizens <span style="text-decoration: underline;">trusted their neighbours</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">felt part of a community</span>, and were even <span style="text-decoration: underline;">able to leave their doors unlocked</span> without fear. A broader definition of safety could also include <span style="text-decoration: underline;">belief in the integrity of state institutions</span>, such as <span style="text-decoration: underline;">governments or police</span> forces, and confidence that we are all <span style="text-decoration: underline;">protected by fair laws</span>.

	<p>
				<p><em><strong>Foreign visitors should pay more than local visitors for cultural and historical attractions. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?</strong></em></p>
<p>It is sometimes argued that tourists from overseas should be charged more than local residents to visit important sites and monuments. I completely disagree with this idea.</p>
<p>The argument in favour of higher prices for foreign tourists would be that cultural or historical attractions often depend on state subsidies to keep them going, which means that the resident population already pays money to these sites through the tax system. However, I believe this to be a very shortsighted view. Foreign tourists contribute to the economy of the host country with the money they spend on a wide range of goods and services, including food, souvenirs, accommodation and travel. The governments and inhabitants of every country should be happy to subsidise important tourist sites and encourage people from the rest of the world to visit them.</p>
<p>If travellers realised that they would have to pay more to visit historical and cultural attractions in a particular nation, they would perhaps decide not to go to that country on holiday. To take the UK as an example, the tourism industry and many related jobs rely on visitors coming to the country to see places like Windsor Castle or Saint Paul’s Cathedral. These two sites charge the same price regardless of nationality, and this helps to promote the nation’s cultural heritage. If overseas tourists stopped coming due to higher prices, there would be a risk of insufficient funding for the maintenance of these important buildings.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I believe that every effort should be made to attract tourists from overseas, and it would be counterproductive to make them pay more than local residents.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Many students ask me about idioms: What are they? Should you use them? Do they help your score?</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Meaning</span><br>My dictionary defines an idiom as "a group of words whose meaning is not deducible from the meaning of each individual word". This means that you cannot understand an idiom by analysing it word for word. For example, "it's a piece of cake" means "it's easy". Phrasal verbs are also idiomatic expressions (e.g. "look up" can mean "search in a dictionary").</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Using idioms</span><br>English speakers use idioms all the time in conversation, but less so in formal/academic speaking and writing contexts. However, we often write things like "focus on an issue" or "the key to solving a problem" and here we are using 'focus' and 'key' in a figurative or idiomatic way.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Idioms in IELTS</span><br>You need to be really careful when using idioms in your IELTS test. Please don't learn lists of idioms; if you use them in the wrong way, your speech/writing will seem forced and unnatural. Also, remember that many idioms are informal or&nbsp;<a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2011/11/ielts-advice-avoid-proverbs-and-clichés.html" target="_self">clichéd</a>. So, what should you do? Read my tip below.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">My tip</span><br>You can only be sure that you are using an idiom correctly if you have seen or heard it used in context. For example, if you've read about someone who "set up a business", you can use that phrase with confidence (and it might help your score). If you've only seen the idiom on a list, don't use it.</p>

				<p>Let's plan and then write <span style="text-decoration: underline;">one</span> main paragraph for the question below.</p>
<p><em><strong>Economic progress is often used to measure a country's success. However, some people believe that other factors are more important. What other factors should also be considered when measuring a country's success? Do you think one factor is more important than others?</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Here's a plan I wrote with my students:</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Paragraph about other factors:</span><br>1) Education for development of the country, providing future workforce. 2) Good health system, living standards, life expectancy. 3) Personal freedom / rights / equality e.g. equal opportunities for both genders.</p>
<p><strong>Here's our full paragraph using the plan above:</strong></p>
<p>Standards of education, health and individual human rights should certainly be considered when measuring a country’s status. A good education system is vital for the development of any nation, with schools, colleges and universities bearing the responsibility for the quality of future generations of workers. Healthcare provision is also an indicator of the standard of living within a country, and this can be measured by looking at average life expectancy rates or availability of medical services. Finally, human rights and levels of equality could be taken into account. For example, a country in which women do not have the same opportunities as men might be considered less successful than a country with better gender equality.</p>

				<p><em><strong>Economic progress is often used to measure a country's success. However, some people believe that other factors are more important. What other factors should also be considered when measuring a country's success? Do you think one factor is more important than others?</strong></em></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Introduction</span>:</strong> Introduce the topic and give a general answer to both questions.</p>
<p>The relative success of different countries is usually defined in economic terms. There are several other factors, apart from the economy, that could be used to assess a country, and in my opinion education is the most important of all.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conclusion</span>:</strong> Repeat / summarise your answer.</p>
<p>In conclusion, nations can be assessed and compared in a variety of ways, but I would argue that the standard of a country's education system is the best indicator of its success.</p>

<ol>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Introduce</span> the topic of measuring a country's success. Then answer that several factors can be considered, and education is the most important (this was the opinion of my students).</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Other factors</span>: 1) Education for development of the country, jobs, people will be more civilized, fewer social problems, less crime e.g. Scandinavian countries. 2) Personal freedom / rights e.g. religion, free speech, political views, gender, race, privacy. 3) Health i.e. good health system, living standards, life expectancy e.g. Japan.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Education</span> is the main factor: education has an effect on all other factors. It affects health - there will be more doctors, more research, medical discoveries; educated people tend to be healthier. It also affects the economy - better work force, more creation of jobs, companies. Prestigious schools and universities attract people from other countries.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conclude</span> by summarising these ideas.</li>

	<p>
				<p>Related to yesterday's lesson, here's a question that a student sent me last year:</p>
<p><em>Hi Simon, when you talk about Band 7+ vocabulary, you  always talk about two or three words (a phrase basically).   But I am trying to learn few "heavy" words like cardinal, multitudinous,  prodigious, prestidigitation, peregrination etc.  Can you please tell us what is more important for  IELTS: "heavy words" or good phrases?</em></p>
<p>My answer to this question is simple: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">good phrases</span> are much more important. The words listed by the student above would seem forced and unnatural, whereas good phrases show your ability to use words together like a native speaker would.</p>
<p>Please don't learn the "heavy" words mentioned by the student. Instead, focus on learning good <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2012/10/ielts-writing-task-2-collocations.html" target="_self">collocations</a> for IELTS topics.</p>

	<p>
				<p>I ban my students from using certain words in the IELTS test. The easiest way for me to explain why I ban these words is that most native speakers wouldn't use them if they were doing the test. Here are a few of my least favourites:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Moreover</strong> - Native speakers hardly ever use this word, and students tend to use it wrongly. Just use 'furthermore' or 'also'.</li>
<li><strong>Demerits</strong> - It's ok to talk about the 'merits' of something, but the word 'demerits' seems unnatural. Just use 'disadvantages' or 'drawbacks'.</li>
<li><strong>Hence / Thusly</strong> - These words sound too formal and old-fashioned. Just use 'therefore' or 'as a result'.</li>

Industry sponsorships can be another useful source of revenue for creative artists. For example, media companies like the mobile giant Apple are often willing to pay huge fees to inspirational designers who work on their advertising campaigns, product packaging, and even the appearance of their electronic devices. Finally, some artists may be lucky enough to receive donations from wealthy individuals.</em></p>

	<p>
				<p>Here's a full essay that I wrote with my students about the topic below.</p>
<p><em><strong>Some people think that governments should give financial support to creative artists such as painters and musicians. Others believe that creative artists should be funded by alternative sources. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.</strong></em></p>
<p>People have different views about the funding of creative artists. While some people disagree with the idea of government support for artists, I believe that money for art projects should come from both governments and other sources.</p>
<p>Some art projects definitely require help from the state. In the UK, there are many works of art in public spaces, such as streets or squares in city centres. In Liverpool, for example, there are several new statues and sculptures in the docks area of the city, which has been redeveloped recently. These artworks represent culture, heritage and history. They serve to educate people about the city, and act as landmarks or talking points for visitors and tourists. Governments and local councils should pay creative artists to produce this kind of art, because without their funding our cities would be much less interesting and attractive.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I can understand the arguments against government funding for art. The main reason for this view is that governments have more important concerns. For example, state budgets need to be spent on education, healthcare, infrastructure and security, among other areas. These public services are vital for a country to function properly, whereas the work of creative artists, even in public places, is a luxury. Another reason for this opinion is that artists do a job like any other professional, and they should therefore earn their own money by selling their work.</p>
<p>In conclusion, there are good reasons why artists should rely on alternative sources of financial support, but in my opinion government help is sometimes necessary.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Students often wonder why their scores fluctuate, especially in the writing and speaking tests. One reason could be that they don't have a method; they approach the exam in a different way every time.</p>
<p>You can only measure your progress if you use the same method every time you take the test. If you always approach the exam in the same way, you will know when you have done well or badly, and if your scores go up or down, you will probably know why.</p>

	<p>
				<p>It's easy to read something (e.g. a lesson on this site) and think that you understand it. But 'understanding' is not the same as 'using'.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Can you really USE everything that you have read?<br>Can you use it correctly, without any mistakes?</strong></p>
<p>Look again at yesterday's lesson about 'lead to'. I'm sure you understand these words, but not many students are able to use them accurately. This is important because it could make the difference between a band 6 and a band 7.</p>
<p>Try to think about these steps when you are studying:</p>
<ol>
<li>Understanding a word is only the first step (e.g. 'lead to' means 'cause')</li>
<li>The next step is seeing how words are used (e.g. 'lead to + noun')</li>
<li>Try to use what you have learnt</li>
<li>Ask a teacher to correct your work</li>
<li>Learn from your mistakes</li>
</ol>

				<p>Students often make mistakes when using 'lead to' in their writing. What's the problem with these sentences?</p>
<ol>
<li>Consumerism can lead to increase the economy.</li>
<li>Tourism can lead to destroy natural habitats.</li>
<li>A competitive atmosphere in lessons leads to motivate students.</li>

<li>Consumerism can lead to a more successful economy.</li>
<li>Tourism can lead to the destruction of natural habitats.</li>
<li>A competitive atmosphere in lessons motivates students.</li>

<p><em>Some art projects definitely require help from the state. In the UK, there are many works of art in public spaces, such as streets or squares in city centres. In Liverpool, for example, there are several new statues and sculptures in the docks area of the city, which has been redeveloped recently. These artworks represent culture, heritage and history. They serve to educate people about the city, and act as landmarks or talking points for visitors and tourists. Governments and local councils should pay creative artists to produce this kind of art, because without their funding our cities would be much less interesting and attractive.</em></p>

	<p>
				<p>When students are stuck on band 6.5 in writing, they often think that they need a new technique, a new book or some new advice. This is wrong!</p>
<p>If you have a 6.5, it means that you are already getting band 7 in 50% of the scoring criteria. For example, you might be getting 7 for task response and 7 for organisation, but 6 for vocabulary and 6 for grammar (examiners can't give half marks in these criteria). Just a small improvement in one area will take you to band 7 overall (e.g. 7,7,7,6 = band 7).</p>
<p>If you are getting band 6.5, your method is fine. Don't change what you're doing; just try to find a small improvement in one area.</p>

	<p>
				<p>A student asked me for some tips about how to write task 2 essays faster. Here's my advice:</p>
<ol>
<li>The first step is to write <em><strong>better</strong></em>, not faster. If you can't get the score you need when it takes you 2 hours to write an essay, you won't be able to write a good essay in 40 minutes.</li>

<li>The next step is to break the 40 minutes into smaller parts. For example, you could practise writing introductions in only 5 minutes. Don't work on full essays yet; just practise the parts according to my advice in <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2012/08/ielts-writing-task-2-how-to-use-your-40-minutes.html" target="_self">this lesson</a>.</li>
<li>Separate the 'thinking' from the 'writing'. I do all my thinking (planning or brainstorming) in the first 10 minutes. When I'm happy with my essay plan, I start writing. I try to stick to my plan so that I can focus on writing rather than more thinking.</li>
<li>Finally, remember that improvements happen <em><strong>gradually</strong></em>. You have to be prepared to do the hard work: practising lots of essays and parts of essays, preparing ideas and opinions for topics, building your vocabulary <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2011/10/ielts-advice-your-repertoire.html" target="_self">repertoire</a>, and learning from mistakes. Do the work and you<em><strong></strong></em>'ll get better <em><strong>and</strong></em> faster!</li>

	<p>
				<p><em><strong>Nowadays animal experiments are widely used to develop new medicines and to test the safety of other products. Some people argue that these experiments should be banned because it is morally wrong to cause animals to suffer, while others are in favour of them because of their benefits to humanity.</strong></em><br><em><strong>Discuss both views and give your own opinion.</strong></em></p>
<p>It is true that medicines and other products are routinely tested on animals before they are cleared for human use. While I tend towards the viewpoint that animal testing is morally wrong, I would have to support a limited amount of animal experimentation for the development of medicines.</p>
<p>On the one hand, there are clear ethical arguments against animal experimentation. To use a common example of this practice, laboratory mice may be given an illness so that the effectiveness of a new drug can be measured. Opponents of such research argue that humans have no right to subject animals to this kind of trauma, and that the lives of all creatures should be respected. They believe that the benefits to humans do not justify the suffering caused, and that scientists should use alternative methods of research.</p>
<p>On the other hand, reliable alternatives to animal experimentation may not always be available. Supporters of the use of animals in medical research believe that a certain amount of suffering on the part of mice or rats can be justified if human lives are saved. They argue that opponents of such research might feel differently if a member of their own families needed a medical treatment that had been developed through the use of animal experimentation. Personally, I agree with the banning of animal testing for non-medical products, but I feel that it may be a necessary evil where new drugs and medical procedures are concerned.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it seems to me that it would be wrong to ban testing on animals for vital medical research until equally effective alternatives have been developed.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Last week I asked you to share your "discuss both views" questions. I've chosen a question shared by JK:</p>
<p><em><strong>Nowadays animal experiments are widely used to develop new medicines and to test the safety of other products. Some people argue that these experiments should be banned because it is morally wrong to cause animals to suffer, while others are in favour of them because of their benefits to humanity.</strong></em><br><em><strong>Discuss both views and give your own opinion.</strong></em></p>
<p>Here are the steps I would take to answer this question:</p>
<ul>
<li>First we need <em><strong>ideas</strong></em>. I would start by writing down some arguments for and against animal testing. I covered this topic in my&nbsp;<a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/ielts-ebook.html" target="_self">ebook</a> (chapter 2), so I already have some good ideas in my head.</li>
<li>Next we can decide on our <em><strong>own view</strong></em>. Looking at the ideas you wrote down, you need to make a decision. A good 'middle point' might be that animal experiments should only be used for the most important medical research.</li>
<li>Now we need to <em><strong>organise</strong></em> our ideas. Always stick to the 4-paragraph structure; you don't need an extra paragraph for your own view because you agree with elements of the two views stated in the question.</li>
<li>Finally we're ready to <em><strong>write</strong></em> the essay. Keep your introduction and conclusion short. Spend most of your time on the main body paragraphs.</li>

	<p>
				<p>Is it acceptable to use memorised phrases in the writing and speaking tests? Well, it depends. Take the sentence below as an example. A student asked me whether it can be used at the beginning of a letter (general writing task 1).</p>
<p><em><strong>I hope this letter ﬁnds you well. Sorry I didn't write to you earlier, but I’ve been working ﬂat out since the moment I arrived home.</strong></em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Good use:</span><br>If the question tells you to begin by explaining to your friend why you haven't contacted him/her for a while, then this sentence would be perfect.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bad use:</span><br>However, if the question does <em><strong>not</strong></em> tell you to explain why you didn't write earlier, the sentence is <em><strong>irrelevant</strong></em>. It will be clear to the examiner that you have used that phrase because it looks good, and not because it fits the question.</p>

<p><em><strong>Which words or phrases in the following paragraph might be considered 'band 7 or higher'?</strong></em></p>
<p>It is true that there are some disadvantages to learning a foreign language at primary school age. The main problem is that young children need to study other subjects which can be considered as more important than a second language. The core subjects in most primary schools are the mother tongue language, mathematics and science, and it can be argued that lessons in a new language take valuable study time away from these key disciplines, as well as causing confusion in the young learners. In particular, some people might worry that lessons in the new language could delay the development of a child’s first language.</p>

				<p>If you have the chance to take some lessons with a private teacher, here are some tips for writing and speaking:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask the teacher to identify your problem areas. Focus on improving those things first.</li>
<li>First, work together on 'big things' like overall essay structure, paragraphs or making sure you answer the question. Only work on 'small things' like grammar mistakes when you have perfected the big things.</li>
<li>Ask your teacher to write a full essay in front of you. Watch how she does it, and ask her to explain what she is thinking as she writes it.</li>
<li>Ask your teacher to mark your essays in front of you, and ask her to explain each correction.</li>
<li>When you practise questions for the speaking test, ask your teacher to play the part of the student. Record her answers and listen to them at home. Try to copy some of the phrases she used.</li>
<li>Practise doing speaking tests, and always ask the teacher for feedback: what did you do that was good, and how could you improve your answers?</li>

	<p>
				<p>I sometimes use the term 'band 7 vocabulary' and several people have asked me to explain what I mean by this. Here goes:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, when I say 'band 7 vocabulary', I'm talking about vocabulary that could help you to get a band 7 <em><strong>or higher</strong></em>.</li>
<li>There is no list of band 7 vocabulary that you can use in any essay.</li>
<li>'Band 7 vocabulary' refers to words and phrases that <em><strong>relate to the question topic</strong></em>. For example, a phrase like "delay the development of a child's first language" would be band 7 vocabulary, but a linking word like "moreover" would not.</li>
<li>Examiners are looking for 'less common' vocabulary. They wouldn't expect many students to write "delay the development of a child's first language", so this phrase would impress them.</li>
<li>Remember that we are <em><strong>not</strong></em> looking for 'big' words that are difficult to understand. We are looking for groups of words used naturally and accurately together. The phrase "delay the development of a child's first language" is easy to understand, but not many students would think to use it.</li>

	<p>
				<p>Students often make mistakes when using these two phrases. To avoid mistakes, follow this simple advice:</p>
<p>- Use <em><strong>For example,</strong></em> at the start of a sentence.<br>- Use <em><strong>such as</strong></em> in the middle of a sentence.</p>

<li>Children should avoid eating junk food <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">such as</span> burgers and chips.</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice that 'For example' is followed by a comma and a full sentence. 'Such as' is in the middle of the sentence, followed by two nouns. You can use 'For instance' instead of 'For example'. You can use 'like' instead of 'such as'.</p>

				<p>Many students do a lot of testing but not enough preparation. The problem with tests is that you don't learn anything new. You don't improve.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>"To train for a marathon, you don't run a full marathon every day!"</strong></em></p>
<p>The solution is to spend more time preparing. Don't test yourself on a new topic that you have no idea about. Spend some time researching the topic to find good ideas and vocabulary. Then try to write a 'perfect' essay using your research, a dictionary, your teacher to help you etc. Type the essay on a computer, check for spelling and grammar mistakes, re-read it, look at how the paragraphs are organised, highlight the 'band 7 vocabulary'. If I've covered the topic on this website, use my ideas to make 'perfect' paragraphs and ask a teacher to check them.</p>
<p>When you have written a 'perfect' essay, wait for a few days and <em>then test yourself</em> on that topic. Imagine the difference!</p>

	<p>
				<p>My students and I worked on this question from Cambridge IELTS 9:</p>
<p><strong><em>Some experts believe that it is better for children to begin learning a foreign language at primary school rather than secondary school. Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?</em></strong></p>
<p>Here's our plan for a 4-paragraph essay:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Introduction</span>: Topic = best age to learn a foreign language. Our opinion = better to learn at primary school age.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Disadvantages</span> of learning languages at primary age: other subjects are more important at that age (maths, mother tongue language, science), learning a new language is confusing and wastes time, could delay development of child's first language.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Advantages</span> of learning languages at primary age: young children learn faster, they are less self-conscious or shy, they pick up the pronunciation better, they enjoy copying and learning through games, nowadays languages are just as important as maths etc.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conclusion</span>: repeat / summarise our answer.</li>
</ol>
<p>The plan took us 10 minutes to write. With a plan like this, it should be easy to write a good essay in 30 minutes.</p>

	<p>
				<p>When learning a language, grammar rules are useful because they show you how the language <em><strong>normally</strong></em> behaves. For example, you might learn that the word "to" is followed by the infinitive of the verb. The rule tells you that "to have" is correct and "to having" is wrong.</p>
<p>However, you should also be prepared to meet some exceptions to the grammar rules that you learn. For example, students are often confused by phrases like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?hl=en&amp;tab=ww#hl=en&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=%22look+forward+to+having%22&amp;oq=%22look+forward+to+having%22&amp;gs_l=hp.3..0l2j0i22i30l2.3191.10075.0.11539.24.24.0.0.0.1.449.2242.19j3j0j1j1.24.0...0.0...1c.1.12.psy-ab.tpFi40mLAuk&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.46340616,d.d2k&amp;fp=a6e63727a0ee5b33&amp;biw=1042&amp;bih=734" target="_self">'look forward to having'</a> or <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?hl=en&amp;tab=ww#hl=en&amp;output=search&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=%22advantages+to+having%22&amp;oq=%22advantages+to+having%22&amp;gs_l=hp.3..0l4.2452.11029.0.11441.22.22.0.0.0.0.97.1089.22.22.0...0.0...1c.1.12.psy-ab.2G3-3BSYbwk&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.46340616,d.d2k&amp;fp=a6e63727a0ee5b33&amp;biw=1042&amp;bih=734" target="_self">'advantages to having'</a>, both of which are correct.</p>
<p>When you find an exception to a grammar rule, don't get frustrated; consider it an opportunity to expand your knowledge of the language, and perhaps to impress the examiner!</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here's a question that my students and I looked at recently:</p>
<p><em><strong>Successful sports professionals can earn a great deal more money than people in other important professions. Some people think this is fully justified while others think it is unfair. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.</strong></em></p>
<p><em>We spent 10 minutes planning, then we wrote <span style="text-decoration: underline;">half</span> of the essay together:</em></p>
<p>It is true that the top sports people earn incredibly high salaries. Although reasons can be given to justify this, I personally believe that sports stars should be paid much less.</p>
<p>There are several reasons why some people support high incomes in sport. Firstly, people who reach the highest levels in any sport must be uniquely talented. For example, it is rare to find someone with the football skills of Messi or Ronaldo, and it can be argued that these players deserve salaries that reflect their abilities. Secondly, even the most talented sports professionals must undergo many years of training to develop the skills and fitness required, and this takes great commitment, dedication and passion. Finally, sports salaries are only high because audiences and fans are willing to pay to watch their favourite stars.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em><br>The main reason why these two paragraphs are good is that we planned them carefully. We spent time thinking about the question, making notes, and organising our ideas in a logical way.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here's the question that we started to look at last week:</p>
<p><em><strong>Marriages are bigger and more expensive nowadays than in the past. Why is this the case? Is it a positive or negative development?</strong></em></p>
<p>After writing the <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2013/04/ielts-writing-task-2-succinct-introductions.html" target="_self">introduction</a>, we need to write a paragraph about the first question (why is this the case?). Here's something I wrote with my students:</p>
<p>Marriages have become bigger and more expensive for three main reasons. Firstly, people in developed countries are wealthier than their ancestors were in the past. They therefore have more money to spend on weddings, which are seen as one of life’s most important and unforgettable occasions. Secondly, in today’s globalized world, people see photos of celebrity weddings and want to copy them. For example, when Prince William got married here in England, the ceremony was shown on television and many people were influenced by what they saw. Finally, the wedding industry has grown, and many companies have an interest in selling products and services to us, using persuasive marketing techniques.</p>

<p>Second, I need a short, simple answer to both parts of the question:<em><strong></strong></em></p>
<p><em>There are several reasons for this, and in my view it is a negative trend.</em></p>

				<p>This week I wrote a lesson about using "Firstly, Secondly, Finally", and a student asked me whether it's ok to use "at last" instead of "finally".</p>
<p>The answer is no. "Finally" and "at last" <em><strong>are not</strong></em> used in the same way.</p>
<p>Use "finally" in the IELTS writing test when you want to make your final point, or to talk about the final stage in a process e.g. Finally, as well as making life more fun and interesting, new experiences can be good for our physical and mental health.

<p>I think this is a good way to organise a paragraph. However, it's best not to use the same structure twice in one essay. Compare the two paragraphs below. How did I structure the second one to avoid repeating "Firstly, Secondly, Finally"?</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">First main paragraph</span><br>There are good reasons why some people feel the need to make significant changes to their lives from time to time. <em><strong>Firstly</strong></em>, any new situation that a person encounters can be an opportunity to learn and grow as a person. A new job, for instance, might present challenges that push the person to adapt, acquire new knowledge, or add to his or her skill set. <em><strong>Secondly</strong></em>, a change can represent a break with the past and an old routine which has become boring and predictable. <em><strong>Finally</strong></em>, as well as making life more fun and interesting, new experiences can be good for our physical and mental health.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Second main paragraph</span><br>On the other hand, it is understandable why people might avoid change. Whenever people are forced to change their lifestyles, jobs or even to move house, they are likely to experience stress and worry as they try to adapt to the new situation. By contrast, we feel comfortable and confident when we stay with what we know. The decision to persist with a course of action or stick to one chosen path often leads to greater success in life. For example, by staying in the same job for many years, a person can become an expert in his or her field, which will lead to better opportunities for promotions and career progression.</p>

<p>Collocations are groups of words that often go together. For example, collocations like "increase significantly" are used in IELTS Writing Task 1.</p>
<p>Look for collocations in the speaking and writing lessons on this website. Here are some examples:</p>

<li><strong>Writing Task 1:</strong> noticeable feature, significantly higher, a dramatic increase in.</li>

<p>It is always a little disconcerting to realise a generation has grown up never knowing what it was like to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">manage without something</span> that is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">taken for granted</span> today. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">A case in point</span>: the World Wide Web (WWW), which celebrated the 20th anniversary of its introduction last Saturday. It is no exaggeration to say that not since the invention of the printing press has a new media technology <span style="text-decoration: underline;">altered the way people think, work and play</span> quite so extensively. With the web having been so thoroughly <span style="text-decoration: underline;">embraced socially, politically and economically</span>, the world has become <span style="text-decoration: underline;">an entirely different place</span> from what it was just two decades ago.</p>

They were worried about the precise meaning of the word "infants", and whether it meant the same thing as "pre-school age children".</p>
<p>In the reading test, you shouldn't worry about such precise distinctions. It's enough to recognise that both "infants" and "pre-school age children" are very young children. The answer would be 'false' if the question mentioned "teenagers" or "adolescents" - these are definitely not pre-school ages.</p>
<p>Remember that the people who write these questions rely on paraphrasing and synonyms; it wouldn't really test your English if every question contained the exact words from the passage. If the words have basically the same meaning, don't analyse them any further.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Many students only do one thing to prepare for writing task 2: they write lots of full essays. Although it's obviously important to practise writing full essays, there are other things that I think you should be doing.</p>
<p>Here are some study ideas for writing task 2:</p>
<p><strong>1) Break the task into parts</strong><br>Instead of writing a full essay today, why not try writing 5 different introductions using my <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2012/11/ielts-writing-task-2-introduction-technique.html" target="_self">2-sentence technique</a>? Or challenge yourself to write 3 different main-body paragraphs about "advantages" (e.g. advantages of mobile phones, homeschooling and immigration) - use <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2011/10/ielts-writing-5-sentence-paragraphs.html" target="_self">this lesson</a> to help you. Or write 5 different conclusions - just one sentence each, summarising your response to 5 different questions.</p>
<p><strong>2) Do some research</strong><br>Instead of worrying about one particular question, try to find 10 recent exam questions (maybe using <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/recent-exam-questions-6.html" target="_self">this page</a>). Write the questions on a piece of paper, decide what the general topic is for each one (e.g. advertising, prisons, life expectancy) and do some research about those topics. Don't worry about the exact question, just try to "collect" good ideas and vocabulary for the overall topic. A quick search on Google or Wikipedia should give you what you need.</p>
<p><strong>3) What do you believe?</strong><br>A big problem for some students is that they don't have well-formed opinions. They're not sure what to write about topics like homeschooling, immigration or gun control. The good news is that there is no 'correct' opinion - the examiner is only looking at how well you express your opinions in English. So, after doing some research (see point 2 above), make sure you have an opinion of your own.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here's my full essay for the question we've been working on.</p>
<p><em><strong>In the developed world, average life expectancy is increasing. What problems will this cause for individuals and society? Suggest some measures that could be taken to reduce the impact of ageing populations.</strong></em></p>
<p>It is true that people in industrialised nations can expect to live longer than ever before. Although there will undoubtedly be some negative consequences of this trend, societies can take steps to mitigate these potential problems.</p>
<p>As people live longer and the populations of developed countries grow older, several related problems can be anticipated. The main issue is that there will obviously be more people of retirement age who will be eligible to receive a pension. The proportion of younger, working adults will be smaller, and governments will therefore receive less money in taxes in relation to the size of the population. In other words, an ageing population will mean a greater tax burden for working adults. Further pressures will include a rise in the demand for healthcare, and the fact young adults will increasingly have to look after their elderly relatives.</p>
<p>There are several actions that governments could take to solve the problems described above. Firstly, a simple solution would be to increase the retirement age for working adults, perhaps from 65 to 70. Nowadays, people of this age tend to be healthy enough to continue a productive working life. A second measure would be for governments to encourage immigration in order to increase the number of working adults who pay taxes. Finally, money from national budgets will need to be taken from other areas and spent on vital healthcare, accommodation and transport facilities for the rising numbers of older citizens.</p>
<p>In conclusion, various measures can be taken to tackle the problems that are certain to arise as the populations of countries grow older.</p>

				<p>Many students are forced to study for the IELTS test alone. For one reason or another, they can't attend any classes or preparation courses. I started this blog with the aim of helping people in that position.</p>
<p>However, those people often reach the point where they need some direct guidance. They need someone to check their essays or listen to them speak.</p>

<ol>
<li>Try to develop each bullet point in detail. If you don't say enough for the first two or three points, you'll find yourself with too much time for the last point.</li>
<li>Tell a story! My second point tells the story of how I was given the chair by a friend, and I could probably speak for 2 minutes about this point alone. When you tell a story about something real that happened, you'll find it easy to keep talking. Stories are also interesting for the listener (the examiner).</li>
<li>Add examples. In point 3, you can see that I added an example at the end ("last night I fell asleep in my armchair while I was watching a film"). I could easily take this example and develop it into another short story.</li>
<li>When describing an object, don't forget the simple things like size, colour (I forgot that one!), shape, material, position ("just under my living room window").</li>

	<p>
				<p><em><strong>Some people regard video games as harmless fun, or even as a useful educational tool. Others, however, believe that video games are having an adverse effect on the people who play them. In your opinion, do the drawbacks of video games outweigh the benefits?</strong></em></p>
<p>Many people, and children in particular, enjoy playing computer games. While I accept that these games can sometimes have a positive effect on the user, I believe that they are more likely to have a harmful impact.</p>
<p>On the one hand, video games can be both entertaining and educational. Users, or gamers, are transported into virtual worlds which are often more exciting and engaging than real-life pastimes. From an educational perspective, these games encourage imagination and creativity, as well as concentration, logical thinking and problem solving, all of which are useful skills outside the gaming context. Furthermore, it has been shown that computer simulation games can improve users’ motor skills and help to prepare them for real-world tasks, such as flying a plane.</p>
<p>However, I would argue that these benefits are outweighed by the drawbacks. Gaming can be highly addictive because users are constantly given scores, new targets and frequent rewards to keep them playing. Many children now spend hours each day trying to progress through the levels of a game or to get a higher score than their friends. This type of addiction can have effects ranging from lack of sleep to problems at school, when homework is sacrificed for a few more hours on the computer or console. The rise in obesity in recent years has also been linked in part to the sedentary lifestyle and lack of exercise that often accompany gaming addiction.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it seems to me that the potential dangers of video games are more significant than the possible benefits.</p>

<p><em><strong>Think about the following points:</strong></em></p>
<p>1) Which type of question do you think is more likely for the 'video games' topic: discussion, agree/disagree or problem/solution?<br>2) Can we use any of the ideas, opinions or vocabulary from yesterday's lesson?<br>3) What other ideas or arguments could we add?</p>
<p><em><strong>Task:</strong></em> try writing your own exam question for this topic. We'll look at a real question next week.</p>

	<p>
				<p>One of the questions in Cambridge IELTS book 8 asks who should be responsible for making children into good citizens: parents or schools?</p>
<p><strong>Here's a paragraph I wrote about this topic:</strong></p>
<p>Parents play a huge ______ in their children’s lives, and shoulder more of the ______ for their upbringing than school teachers do. Before starting school, infants spend the first four or five years of their lives with their mothers and fathers. During those ______ years, parents teach their children vital skills and habits, such as the ability to speak, eat and behave. Parents are the major role ______ for young people, who copy the behaviour that they see on a daily ______ at home, and it would be wrong to expect schools to ______ a greater influence than the family.</p>

If you are <a href="http://www.idiomeanings.com/idioms/stuck-in-a-rut/" target="_self">stuck in a rut</a> like this, perhaps the most effective way to get out of it is to give more importance to your essay plan.</p>

	<p>
				<p><em><strong>There are many different types of music in the world today. Why do we need music? Is the traditional music of a country more important than the international music that is heard everywhere nowadays?</strong></em></p>
<p>It is true that a rich variety of musical styles can be found around the world. Music is a vital part of all human cultures for a range of reasons, and I would argue that traditional music is more important than modern, international music.</p>
<p>Music is something that accompanies all of us throughout our lives. As children, we are taught songs by our parents and teachers as a means of learning language, or simply as a form of enjoyment. Children delight in singing with others, and it would appear that the act of singing in a group creates a connection between participants, regardless of their age. Later in life, people’s musical preferences develop, and we come to see our favourite songs as part of our life stories. Music both expresses and arouses emotions in a way that words alone cannot. In short, it is difficult to imagine life without it.</p>
<p>In my opinion, traditional music should be valued over the international music that has become so popular. International pop music is often catchy and fun, but it is essentially a commercial product that is marketed and sold by business people. Traditional music, by contrast, expresses the culture, customs and history of a country. Traditional styles, such as ...(example)..., connect us to the past and form part of our cultural identity. It would be a real pity if pop music became so predominant that these national styles disappeared.</p>
<p>In conclusion, music is a necessary part of human existence, and I believe that traditional music should be given more importance than international music.</p>

				<p>The examiners' band descriptor sheet states that a band 7 essay <em><strong>"presents a clear position throughout the response"</strong></em>.</p>
<p>A "clear position" means that your opinion must be clear (if the question asks for it), and "throughout the response" means from the beginning to the end of your essay.</p>
<p>For this reason, it's a bad idea to save your opinion for the conclusion. We don't like 'surprise conclusions' in English academic writing. Instead, you should state your position in the introduction, support it in your main paragraphs, and repeat or summarise it in the conclusion.</p>

<p><strong>Paragraph 2: prisons do punish offenders</strong><br>Punishment makes offenders think, reflect, feel sorry, understand the consequences (that we have choices about the actions we take), suffering, revenge / justice for victims, debt to society, taking away freedom and privileges, miss family, deter people from committing crimes in future - fear of prison</p>
<p><strong>Paragraph 3: other purposes of prisons</strong><br>Reflection time, rehabilitation - help the prisoner to prepare for normal life: new skills, education, courses, qualifications, treatment - reform, reeducate, find employment, re-enter society - address the root causes of crime</p>

<p><em><strong>In many countries nowadays, young single people no longer stay with their parents until they are married, but leave to study or work somewhere else.<br>Do you think this trend has more advantages or disadvantages?</strong></em></p>
<p>Here are some tips to help with this kind of question:</p>
<ol>
<li>Notice that the question includes the words "do you think". This tells you that you need to give your own opinion, as well as discussing both the advantages and disadvantages. Put your opinion in the introduction and conclusion, and don't be afraid to use the word "I" (e.g. I believe) to make it clear what <em><strong>you</strong></em> think.</li>
<li>You won't be able to write a good essay if you don't plan your ideas first. Spend 2-3 minutes noting down ideas for the advantages of leaving home before marriage, then 2-3 minutes writing notes for the disadvantages. Then decide what your opinion is, according to whether you have more advantages or disadvantages.</li>
<li>If you can't think of any ideas, start by thinking of some examples e.g. Did you or any of your friends leave home before getting married? Do you know anyone who lived with their parents until they got married? What were the reasons and benefits or drawbacks of each decision?</li>

	<p>
				<p>People often ask whether it's a good idea to ask for a re-mark of their tests. Here are a few tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't recommend asking for your reading or listening paper to be re-marked. Reading and listening questions are either right or wrong, so it's unlikely that your scores will change.</li>
<li>If there is a 2 band difference between your writing and speaking scores, they are usually double-checked automatically, so a re-mark probably won't help.</li>
<li>A re-mark might be worth trying if you only need an extra half band in speaking or writing (e.g. if you have 6.5 and need 7).</li>
<li>Remember that it can take up to 8 weeks to get your test re-marked. It might be faster to resit the test.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em><br>If you have had a test re-marked, please tell us what happened. It would be interesting to know how many people's scores went up.</p>

	<p>
				<p>My students and I followed the advice in <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2012/07/ielts-writing-task-2-from-ideas-to-paragraph.html" target="_self">last week's lesson</a> to write a paragraph for the topic below.</p>
<p><em><strong>The number of plants and animals is declining. Describe the problem and suggest some solutions.</strong></em></p>
<p>Ideas for describing the problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>over-farming, land needed for crops and animals</li>
<li>cutting down trees destroys natural habitats, animals become extinct</li>
<li>industrial waste in rivers, sea</li>
<li>chemicals kill fish and plants, interrupt natural cycles / food chain</li>
</ul>
<p>It seemed that we had 2 main ideas, so we wrote a 2-idea paragraph:</p>
<p>There are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">two main reasons</span> why plants and animals are disappearing. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Firstly</span>, in many parts of the world trees are being cut down to make way for farmland on which to grow crops and keep animals. The result of this is that natural habitats are being destroyed, and in some cases whole species of animals are becoming extinct. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Secondly</span>, human activity is also responsible for the destruction of aquatic life as domestic and industrial waste is pumped into rivers and seas. This chemical waste kills plants and fish, interrupting natural cycles and having a devastating effect on food chains.</p>

	<p>
				<p>I always tell my students to plan ideas for their main body paragraphs. Let's look at how to put some ideas together to make a paragraph. Here's the question:</p>
<p><em><strong>The main reason people go to work is to earn money.</strong></em><br><em><strong>To what extent do you agree or disagree?</strong></em></p>
<p>Ideas for one main paragraph:</p>
<ul>
<li>agree that money is the main reason people work</li>
<li>people look at salary first, they rarely take a salary cut</li>
<li>need to live, pay bills, food etc.</li>
<li>look after our families, save for the future</li>
<li>otherwise, most people would probably choose not to work</li>
</ul>
<p>Full paragraph using the ideas above:</p>
<p>I agree that the majority of people work in order to earn money. Before taking any other factors into account, it is normal to first consider the salary that a particular post offers, and it is rare to hear of a person who happily takes a cut in pay when beginning a new job. We all need money to pay for our basic necessities, such as accommodation, bills and food. Many adults also have families who depend on the wages they earn, and at the same time they are conscious of the need to save for the future. If we no longer needed money, I doubt most of us would choose to continue in our jobs.</p>

	<p>
				<p><em><strong>Some people think that all teenagers should be required to do unpaid work in their free time to help the local community. They believe this would benefit both the individual teenager and society as a whole.</strong></em><br><em><strong>Do you agree or disagree?</strong></em></p>
<p>Many young people work on a volunteer basis, and this can only be beneficial for both the individual and society as a whole. However, I do not agree that we should therefore force all teenagers to do unpaid work.</p>
<p>Most young people are already under enough pressure with their studies, without being given the added responsibility of working in their spare time. School is just as demanding as a full-time job, and teachers expect their students to do homework and exam revision on top of attending lessons every day. When young people do have some free time, we should encourage them to enjoy it with their friends or to spend it doing sports and other leisure activities. They have many years of work ahead of them when they finish their studies.</p>
<p>At the same time, I do not believe that society has anything to gain from obliging young people to do unpaid work. In fact, I would argue that it goes against the values of a free and fair society to force a group of people to do something against their will. Doing this can only lead to resentment amongst young people, who would feel that they were being used, and parents, who would not want to be told how to raise their children. Currently, nobody is forced to volunteer, and this is surely the best system.</p>
<p>In conclusion, teenagers may choose to work for free and help others, but in my opinion we should not make this compulsory.</p>

	<p>
				<p>My normal advice for task 2 introductions is this: write two sentences - one to introduce the essay topic, and one to give a basic answer to the question. But what should you put in the second sentence (basic answer) if the question doesn't ask for your opinion?</p>
<p><strong>Here are two example questions:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Many people believe that an effective public transport system is a key component of a modern city. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of public transport.</li>
<li>Crime rates tend to be higher in cities than in smaller towns. Explain some possible reasons for this problem, and suggest some solutions.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Here are two sample introductions:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Officials in many cities are keen to develop efficient public transport systems. While public transport has many benefits, there are also some drawbacks which are worth considering.</li>
<li>Cities generally experience higher levels of criminality than towns or villages. There are various reasons for this, but measures could be taken to tackle the problem.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hopefully you can see that it's quite easy to write an introduction for these types of question. The approach is the same (topic + basic answer) whether the question asks for your opinion or not.</p>

<p>Positives of advances in food technology:</p>
<ul>
<li>Farmers can produce crops that grow bigger and faster.</li>
<li>Genetically modified crops may be more resistant to disease or insects.</li>
<li>This could be important for food production in developing countries.</li>

<p>Negatives of advances in food technology:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many people distrust foods that have been modified or processed.</li>
<li>They prefer organic foods which are produced without chemicals.</li>
<li>Farming without fertilisers or pesticides is more environmentally friendly.</li>
<li>There may be risks involved in the genetic engineering of foods.</li>

	<p>
				<p>In today's lesson I'll try to explain what makes a good paragraph. We'll analyse a paragraph that I wrote with some of my students.</p>
<p><em><strong>Paragraph about the purpose of prisons:</strong></em></p>
<p>On the one hand, criminals do need to be punished in some way. A person who <span style="text-decoration: underline;">commits a crime</span> must learn that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">unlawful actions have consequences</span>. Prison sentences punish <span style="text-decoration: underline;">offenders</span> because they <span style="text-decoration: underline;">lose their freedom</span>, and are separated from family and friends. In this way, prison <span style="text-decoration: underline;">acts as a deterrent</span> to make people think carefully before <span style="text-decoration: underline;">breaking the law</span>. Last year in the UK, many people were given a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">prison sentence</span> for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">rioting</span>, and hopefully this punishment will <span style="text-decoration: underline;">deter them from similar behaviour</span> in future.</p>
<p><em><strong>Analysis:</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>The paragraph contains 5 sentences, with a total of 85 words. This is the kind of length I suggest aiming for.</li>
<li>The first sentence is short and simple. We often call this type of sentence a 'topic sentence' because it introduces the topic of the paragraph.</li>
<li>Sentences 2, 3 and 4 develop the main idea in a logical, step-by-step way: crime has consequences - loss of freedom is the punishment - this stops people from breaking the law.</li>
<li>Sentence 5 contains a real example.</li>
<li>Remember that good vocabulary is the key to a high score. I've underlined the best words and phrases in the paragraph.</li>

<p><em><strong>Some people believe that hobbies need to be difficult to be enjoyable.</strong></em><br><em><strong>To what extent do you agree or disagree?</strong></em></p>
<p>Some hobbies are relatively easy, while others present more of a challenge. Personally, I believe that both types of hobby can be fun, and I therefore disagree with the statement that hobbies need to be difficult in order to be enjoyable.</p>
<p>On the one hand, many people enjoy easy hobbies. One example of an activity that is easy for most people is swimming. This hobby requires very little equipment, it is simple to learn, and it is inexpensive. I remember learning to swim at my local swimming pool when I was a child, and it never felt like a demanding or challenging experience. Another hobby that I find easy and fun is photography. In my opinion, anyone can take interesting pictures without knowing too much about the technicalities of operating a camera. Despite being straightforward, taking photos is a satisfying activity.</p>
<p>On the other hand, difficult hobbies can sometimes be more exciting. If an activity is more challenging, we might feel a greater sense of satisfaction when we manage to do it successfully. For example, film editing is a hobby that requires a high level of knowledge and expertise. In my case, it took me around two years before I became competent at this activity, but now I enjoy it much more than I did when I started. I believe that many hobbies give us more pleasure when we reach a higher level of performance because the results are better and the feeling of achievement is greater.</p>
<p>In conclusion, simple hobbies can be fun and relaxing, but difficult hobbies can be equally pleasurable for different reasons.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em><br>Notice that we used examples as the basis of both main paragraphs.</p>

				<p>Did you try planning some ideas for last week's essay question?</p>
<p><em><strong>Some people believe that hobbies need to be difficult to be enjoyable.</strong></em><br><em><strong>To what extent do you agree or disagree?</strong></em></p>
<p>When I wrote my list of hobbies, I realised that some were easy and others were difficult. As a result, I'd say that "I partly agree" with the statement.</p>
<p>Here's my 4-paragraph essay plan:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Introduction</span> - write 2 sentences: introduce the topic, and give an overall answer.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Main paragraph</span> - about difficult hobbies. My examples: swimming, football, chess. Most sports and games are difficult, but the challenge makes them more enjoyable, especially when you can see that you are improving.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Main paragraph</span> - about easy hobbies. My examples: photography, reading, cinema. In my opinion, you do not need to be an expert to enjoy taking photos, reading books, or watching films. I find these activities both easy and enjoyable.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conclusion</span> - repeat / summarise your answer in one sentence.</li>

	<p>
				<p>Here are some simple rules to help you with punctuation for IELTS writing:</p>
<p><strong>Full stops</strong><br>Full stops are very important. Put a clear full stop at the end of each sentence, and then begin the next sentence with a capital letter. If you don't do this, you will get a low score.</p>
<p><strong>Commas</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>When you start a sentence with these words, put a comma after them:<br>Nowadays, Recently, Firstly, Secondly, Finally, Furthermore, In addition, Also, However, By contrast, On the other hand, In my opinion,...</li>
<li>We use commas in lists:<br>e.g. This problem affects individuals, communities and society in general.</li>
<li>We don't usually put a comma after the word "that":<br>e.g. It is clear that the rate of immigration increased.</li>
<li>Don't worry about other uses of commas. The use of a comma is often optional in other situations.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Apostrophes</strong><br>Avoid contractions in IELTS writing. Use "do not" instead of "don't".<br>You may sometimes need to show possession e.g. the government's decision.</p>
<p><strong>Other punctuation</strong><br>You don't really need to use any other punctuation in IELTS writing.<br>My advice is to avoid trying to use colons and semicolons.</p>

	<p>
				<p>If you can't think of any good ideas for an essay, try thinking about some examples first. Plan your essay around the examples. Take this question:</p>
<p><em><strong>Some people believe that hobbies need to be difficult to be enjoyable.</strong></em><br><em><strong>To what extent do you agree or disagree?</strong></em></p>
<p>Use examples to give you ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make a list of some hobbies: either your own hobbies, or some typical hobbies that you can easily write about. Label each hobby 'easy' or 'difficult'.</li>
<li>Look at your list. Is there a balance between easy and difficult hobbies, or is your list one-sided? The answer to this question will give you your overall opinion.</li>
<li>Finally, write down a few reasons why each hobby is easy or difficult. Is there a connection between the difficulty of the hobby and the enjoyment you get from it?</li>

<li>2-part question</li>

<p>Important points to remember:</p>
<ol>
<li>An 'opinion' question asks for your view, not the views of other people, and you don't have to give both sides of the argument. Just make your opinion clear in the introduction, then explain it in the rest of the essay.</li>
<li>A 'discussion' question requires you to write about both sides of the argument, and you should write a similar amount for each view. If the question also asks for your opinion, you don't need an extra paragraph. Just make it clear in the introduction and conclusion which of the two views you agree with.</li>
<li>Type 3 is easy. Simply write a paragraph explaining the problem(s) and a paragraph explaining the solution(s). Some questions ask about 'causes' or 'effects': these would be part of the 'problem' paragraph.</li>
<li>For type 4, just answer the two questions. Write one paragraph about each.</li>

	<p>
				<p>A good way to start a paragraph is with a short, simple sentence that introduces the main idea of the paragraph. Teachers often call this a ‘topic sentence’.</p>
<p>I normally write my topic sentences by thinking about how many points I want to mention in the paragraph:<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>1. If I only have one point or idea, I usually state it straight away:</strong></p>
<p>In my opinion, junk food is the main cause of childhood obesity.<br>(then explain this opinion and give examples in the rest of the paragraph)<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>2. If I have two or three points or ideas, I don’t usually mention them directly in the topic sentence:</strong></p>
<p>There are two main causes (or ‘several causes’) of childhood obesity.<br>(then explain using “firstly, secondly...” or something similar)</p>
<p>Have a look through the essays that you’ve written in the past, and compare them with some of mine. Did you begin your main paragraphs with good topic sentences?</p>

	<p>
				<p>For 'agree or disagree' essays, do you think you should give both sides of the argument or just one side? The answer is that you can do either.</p>
<p>A) Essay structure for one side of the argument:</p>
<ol>
<li>Introduction: topic + your opinion (either agree or disagree)</li>
<li>First idea to support your opinion</li>
<li>Second idea to support your opinion</li>
<li>Conclusion: repeat your opinion</li>

<p>B) Essay structure for giving both sides:</p>
<ol>
<li>Introduction: topic + say that you 'partly agree'</li>
<li>On the one hand,...</li>
<li>On the other hand,...</li>
<li>Conclusion: repeat that you accept elements of both arguments</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember: it's very important to get the introduction right. This tells the examiner whether you are going to give one side of the argument or both sides.</p>

	<p>
				<p>A few people have asked me whether using "firstly, secondly, finally" to organise a paragraph is too <em><strong>easy</strong></em>.</p>
<p>My answer is that using easy organising language like "firstly, secondly, finally" allows you to focus on the <em><strong>real content</strong></em> of what you are writing - topic vocabulary, collocations, examples. This is what the examiner wants to see. You can get a band 9 using "firstly, secondly, finally" if the ideas between these linking words are good.</p>
<p>Some simple alternatives to "firstly, secondly, finally" could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>The main reason why I believe... is... / Another argument is... / Also,...</li>
<li>One problem is that... / Furthermore,... / Another drawback is that...</li>

	<p>
				<p>Several people have asked me about this question from Cambridge IELTS 8. I wrote the essay below with the help of some of my students. A few simple linking features are highlighted.</p>
<p><em><strong>Nowadays the way many people interact with each other has changed because of technology.</strong></em><br><em><strong>In what ways has technology affected the types of relationships that people make?</strong></em><em><strong> Has this been a positive or negative development?</strong></em></p>
<p>It is true that new technologies have had an influence on communication between people. Technology has affected relationships in various ways, and in my opinion there are both positive and negative effects.</p>
<p>Technology has had an impact on relationships in business, education and social life. <span style="background-color: #bfbfff;">Firstly</span>, telephones and the Internet allow business people in different countries to interact without ever meeting each other. <span style="background-color: #bfbfff;">Secondly</span>, services like Skype create new possibilities for relationships between students and teachers. For example, a student can now take video lessons with a teacher in a different city or country. <span style="background-color: #bfbfff;">Finally</span>, many people use social networks, like Facebook, to make new friends and find people who share common interests, and they interact through their computers rather than face to face.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: #bfbfff;">On the one hand</span>, these developments can be extremely positive. Cooperation between people in different countries was much more difficult when communication was limited to written letters or telegrams. Nowadays, interactions by email, phone or video are almost as good as face-to-face meetings, and many of us benefit from these interactions, either in work or social contexts. <span style="background-color: #bfbfff;">On the other hand</span>, the availability of new communication technologies can also have the result of isolating people and discouraging real interaction. For example, many young people choose to make friends online rather than mixing with their peers in the real world, and these ‘virtual’ relationships are a poor substitute for real friendships.</p>
<p>In conclusion, technology has certainly revolutionised communication between people, but not all of the outcomes of this revolution have been positive.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here are my 'main body' paragraphs for last week's question. Notice that it's possible to put advantages and disadvantages together in the same paragraph. Also, you need to be careful not to write too much!</p>
<p><em><strong>Advantages / disadvantages of books:</strong></em></p>
<p>The main advantage of books is that they are usually considered to be reliable sources of information. People tend to refer to books when they want to research a subject in depth, and for this reason they continue to play an important role in education. On the other hand, books quickly go out of date, and therefore they are not the best medium for communicating news stories.</p>
<p><em><strong>Advantages / disadvantages of radio:</strong></em></p>
<p>Radio is a much more effective medium than books for the communication of up-to-date information. We can listen to news broadcasts about events as they happen, and a key benefit of radio is that we can listen to it while doing other activities, such as driving or working. The main drawback of radio, when compared to books or television, is that there is no visual element; we cannot see what the broadcaster is describing.</p>
<p><em><strong>Advantages / disadvantages of TV, and my opinion:</strong></em></p>
<p>In my opinion, television is the most effective of these three media because it brings us closer to reality than a book or radio programme ever can. For example, we can watch events as they take place on the other side of the world, or we can see the body language of a politician who is being interviewed. The disadvantages of television are that programmes tend to be short and interrupted by advertisements, meaning that information is presented in limited depth.</p>

				<p>Yesterday I made the point that 'real content' (topic-specific words and phrases) is much more important than linking phrases. To see a good example of real content, look back to Wednesday's lesson about main body paragraphs.</p>
<p>Here's some of the band 7-9 vocabulary that I used:</p>
<ul>
<li>a defined career path</li>
<li>a great sense of satisfaction</li>
<li>work towards (and gradually achieve) goals</li>
<li>realise an ambition</li>
<li>gain the relevant qualifications</li>
<li>undertake years of training</li>
<li>find their work rewarding</li>
<li>invest time and effort</li>

<p>The above phrases came from just one paragraph! To be honest, the paragraphs I wrote on Wednesday are beyond (better than) what an examiner would ever expect to read. So don't worry if you can't write paragraphs like that; just try to learn something from them.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here are my 2 main body paragraphs for <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2012/01/ielts-writing-task-2-rules-for-introductions.html" target="_self">last week's question</a>. I tried to use an "Idea, Explain, Example" structure for the first paragraph, and a "Firstly, Secondly, Finally" structure for the second.</p>
<p><em><strong>Main body paragraphs:</strong></em></p>
<p>On the one hand, having a defined career path can certainly lead to a satisfying working life. Many people decide as young children what they want to do as adults, and it gives them a great sense of satisfaction to work towards their goals and gradually achieve them. For example, many children dream of becoming doctors, but to realise this ambition they need to gain the relevant qualifications and undertake years of training. In my experience, very few people who have qualified as doctors choose to change career because they find their work so rewarding, and because they have invested so much time and effort to reach their goal.</p>
<p>On the other hand, people find happiness in their working lives in different ways. Firstly, not everyone dreams of doing a particular job, and it can be equally rewarding to try a variety of professions; starting out on a completely new career path can be a reinvigorating experience. Secondly, some people see their jobs as simply a means of earning money, and they are happy if their salary is high enough to allow them to enjoy life outside work. Finally, job satisfaction is often the result of working conditions, rather than the career itself. For example, a positive working atmosphere, enthusiastic colleagues, and an inspirational boss can make working life much more satisfying, regardless of the profession.</p>

	<p>
				<p><em><strong>Many people decide on a career path early in their lives and keep to it. This, they argue, leads to a more satisfying working life.</strong></em><br><em><strong>To what extent do you agree with this view?</strong></em><br><em><strong>What other things can people do in order to have a satisfying working life?</strong></em></p>
<p>In today's lesson I just want to look at how to write an introduction for this type of question. My simple rules for task 2 introductions are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write 2 sentences: introduce the topic, then give a general answer.</li>
<li>Mention everything that the question mentions.</li>
<li>Don't save any surprises for the conclusion; give your opinion in the introduction if the question asks for it.</li>
</ol>
<p><em><strong>Here's an example introduction:</strong></em></p>
<p>It is true that some people know from an early age what career they want to pursue, and they are happy to spend the rest of their lives in the same profession. While I accept that this may suit many people, I believe that others enjoy changing careers or seeking job satisfaction in different ways.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here is a question that a lot of students ask:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Is it acceptable to use "I" or "my" in IELTS writing?</strong></em></p>
<p>As an ex-examiner, my advice is that you <strong>should</strong> use phrases like "I believe" or "in my opinion" when the question asks for <strong>your opinion</strong> e.g To what extent do <strong>you</strong> agree or disagree?</p>
<p>Some teachers tell students not to use "I" in academic essays, but this advice is really for university academic writing, not IELTS.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Most grammar books will tell you that you need "the" before a superlative like "highest" or "lowest", but this is not always true.</p>
<ul>
<li>We use "the" when there is a noun after the adjective e.g. the highest number, the highest proportion.</li>
<li>When we put the noun before, we don't need "the" e.g. the number was highest, the proportion was highest.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, compare these 2 sentences:</p>
<p>- The UK had <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">the highest</span> rate of unemployment.<br>- The unemployment rate was <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">highest</span> in the UK.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Following on from yesterday's listening lesson, here is a paragraph explaining some of the benefits of nuclear power:</p>
<p>There are several benefits to building more nuclear power stations. Firstly, nuclear power is a relatively sustainable energy source, meaning that it can be used to produce electricity without wasting limited natural resources like coal, oil or gas. Secondly, nuclear power stations are cleaner than fossil fuel power stations, and could help to reduce carbon emissions that cause global warming. With improvements in nuclear technology, the risks of accidents are being reduced. As a result, many countries are now considering nuclear power as a solution to high oil and gas prices, increasing demand for electricity, and worries about pollution and climate change.</p>
<p>Read, analyse and use the paragraph:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many sentences are there, and what does each sentence do?</li>
<li>Note the main ideas and collocations (e.g. sustainable energy source).</li>
<li>Try to rewrite the paragraph using only your notes.</li>
</ul>
<p>PS. If you have my <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/ielts-ebook.html">ebook</a>, you will find some ideas for the 'negatives of nuclear power' in the environment chapter on page 19.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Yesterday I said that linking words don't help your vocabulary score, and that you need to use 'topic specific' vocabulary if you want a high score.</p>
<p>But what is 'topic specific' vocabulary?</p>
<p>The answer is: vocabulary that you would probably only use for one particular essay question. For example, I used this vocabulary in a lesson last week:</p>
<p>- impoverished or disadvantaged<br>- prioritise local charity<br>- those who live beyond our national borders<br>- curable diseases<br>- paying for vaccines that already exist</p>
<p>You might be able to adapt these phrases to a different topic, but it wouldn't be easy; they are quite specific to the particular question in <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2011/12/ielts-writing-task-2-help-essay.html" target="_self">this lesson</a>.

	<p>
				<p>If the question asks you to explain a problem related to the environment, you could write about global warming.</p>
<p><strong><em>Here is a paragraph explaining the problem (causes) of global warming:</em></strong></p>
<p>Perhaps the most serious problem facing the environment is global warming. Gases such as carbon dioxide trap heat from the sun within the earth’s atmosphere, and this causes global temperatures to rise. This process is known as the greenhouse effect, and human activity is a major factor in the rise of the greenhouse gases which cause it. For example, factories and vehicles produce emissions and exhaust fumes. As many developing countries are becoming industrialised, emissions from factories are expected to increase. Furthermore, the number of cars on our streets is growing all the time, and cheap air travel is making flying accessible to more and more people. Consequently, the amount of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere shows no signs of decreasing.</p>
<p>You can learn a lot from this paragraph if you analyse it:</p>
<ol>
<li>How many sentences are there? What does each sentence do? (e.g. The first sentence introduces the topic)</li>
<li>Can you find some "band 7 vocabulary"?</li>

	<p>
				<p>Last week I wrote a plan for the question below. Now you can read my full essay.</p>
<p><em><strong>We cannot help everyone in the world that needs help, so we should only be concerned with our own communities and countries.</strong></em><br><em><strong>To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?</strong></em></p>
<p>Some people believe that we should not help people in other countries as long as there are problems in our own society. I disagree with this view because I believe that we should try to help as many people as possible.</p>
<p>On the one hand, I accept that it is important to help our neighbours and fellow citizens. In most communities there are people who are impoverished or disadvantaged in some way. It is possible to find homeless people, for example, in even the wealthiest of cities, and for those who are concerned about this problem, there are usually opportunities to volunteer time or give money to support these people. In the UK, people can help in a variety of ways, from donating clothing to serving free food in a soup kitchen. As the problems are on our doorstep, and there are obvious ways to help, I can understand why some people feel that we should prioritise local charity.</p>
<p>At the same time, I believe that we have an obligation to help those who live beyond our national borders. In some countries the problems that people face are much more serious than those in our own communities, and it is often even easier to help. For example, when children are dying from curable diseases in African countries, governments and individuals in richer countries can save lives simply by paying for vaccines that already exist. A small donation to an international charity might have a much greater impact than helping in our local area.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it is true that we cannot help everyone, but in my opinion national boundaries should not stop us from helping those who are in need.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Somebody asked me about the difference between these 4 words (for IELTS writing task 1). I'll try to explain some basic ways to use them.</p>
<p><strong>number</strong><br>- Use "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">the number of</span> + plural noun" e.g. the number of visitors.<br>- Don't use it to describe percentages or uncountable nouns e.g. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">money</span>.</p>
<p><strong>amount</strong><br>- Use "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">the amount of</span> + uncountable noun" e.g. the amount of money.<br>- Don't use it with countable nouns e.g. the amount of <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">person</span>/<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">people</span>.</p>
<p><strong>proportion</strong><br>- Only use this to describe percentages (not numbers).<br>- Use "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">the proportion of</span> + plural noun" e.g. the proportion of people.</p>
<p><strong>figure</strong><br>- Use "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">the figure for</span> + plural noun" e.g. the figure for visitors to the UK.<br>- Use it with uncountable nouns e.g. the figure for unemployment.<br>- Use it with countries e.g. the figure for Canada.<br>- Use it with percentages e.g. the figure (for...) rose to 10%.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em><br>If you've read any of my task 1 essays, you'll see that I like "the figure for" because it can be used in almost any situation.</p>

				<p>Some students (both in my classes and online) find it hard to believe that all of my essays are band 9. They are under the impression that you need to use "difficult" language to get a high score. This is how I respond:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is "difficult" language? Language is not mathematics; anyone can learn and understand a word or phrase.</li>
<li>The most difficult thing is using words together correctly and naturally. Small words like articles and prepositions cause the most problems.</li>
<li>If an essay has no grammar mistakes and a mix of long and short sentences, it's almost certain that it will get band 9 for grammar.</li>
<li>If ideas are explained and developed in a clear, logical way, you will get a high score for coherence and cohesion.</li>
<li>If you try to make your writing over-complicated, it will seem forced and unnatural.</li>
</ul>

	<p>
				<p>Before you start writing your task 2 essay, you need a plan:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, think about how you could write 2 main body paragraphs. What would be the main idea/topic of each one?</li>
<li>Then make some notes for the first main paragraph. Your notes could follow this formula: Idea, Explain, Example.</li>
<li>Do the same thing for the second main paragraph.</li>

<ol>
<li>I can see two clear ideas in this question: 1) buying things has made our lives more comfortable. 2) traditional values and customs have been lost. I agree with both of these points, so I'll write one paragraph explaining why I agree with the first point, and another paragraph explaining the second point.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Idea:</span> buying things has made life more comfortable. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Explain/Examples:</span> we buy appliances like microwave ovens and dishwashers; we use computers to shop online; more people own a car.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Idea:</span> traditional values and customs have been lost. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Explain/Examples:</span> people buy microwave meals rather than cooking traditional dishes; traditional local shops disappear and are replaced with online shopping; people are more independent, but lack a sense of community.</li>

	<p>
				<p>Here are some mistakes that can really affect your IELTS score:</p>
<ol>
<li>Writing less than 150 or 250 words. My advice: count how many words you write, on average, per line. If you write about 10 words per line, make sure that you write more than 25 lines for writing task 2.</li>
<li>Not separating paragraphs. Your score will immediately drop if you don't separate paragraphs clearly. My advice: leave a full line between paragraphs.</li>
<li>Not answering the question (writing and speaking). My advice: in the writing exam, keep checking the question to make sure you are answering it fully. In the speaking exam, answer the question directly, then explain your answer.</li>
<li>Not finishing the reading test. My advice: you must get to the end of the test paper. If you get stuck on a difficult question, miss it out and return to it later.</li>
<li>Making spelling mistakes in the listening test. My advice: if you have a spelling problem, you must keep a list of your mistakes and learn the correct spellings by heart. Test yourself every day.</li>

	<p>
				<p>Here's my full (band 9) essay for last week's question.</p>
<p><em><strong>In recent years, there has been growing interest in the relationship between equality and personal achievement. Some people believe that individuals can achieve more in egalitarian societies. Others believe that high levels of personal achievement are possible only if individuals are free to succeed or fail according to their individual merits.</strong></em><br><em><strong>What is your view of the relationship between equality and personal success?</strong></em></p>
<p>In my opinion, an egalitarian society is one in which everyone has the same rights and the same opportunities. I completely agree that people can achieve more in this kind of society.</p>
<p>Education is an important factor with regard to personal success in life. I believe that all children should have access to free schooling, and higher education should be either free or affordable for all those who chose to pursue a university degree. In a society without free schooling or affordable higher education, only children and young adults from wealthier families would have access to the best learning opportunities, and they would therefore be better prepared for the job market. This kind of inequality would ensure the success of some but harm the prospects of others.</p>
<p>I would argue that equal rights and opportunities are not in conflict with people’s freedom to succeed or fail. In other words, equality does not mean that people lose their motivation to succeed, or that they are not allowed to fail. On the contrary, I believe that most people would feel more motivated to work hard and reach their potential if they thought that they lived in a fair society. Those who did not make the same effort would know that they had wasted their opportunity. Inequality, on the other hand, would be more likely to demotivate people because they would know that the odds of success were stacked in favour of those from privileged backgrounds.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it seems to me that there is a positive relationship between equality and personal success.</p>
<p>(260 words)</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em><br>I'm not sure that this was a 'real' IELTS question (maybe the student who sent it to me remembered it wrongly) because it is a bit confusing: it seems strange to me to imply that "egalitarian/equality" is the opposite of "free to succeed or fail". Anyway, I hope you still find the essay useful.</p>

	<p>
				<p>I student sent me this question, and I agree that it's difficult:</p>
<p><em><strong>In recent years, there has been growing interest in the relationship between equality and personal achievement. Some people believe that individuals can achieve more in egalitarian societies. Others believe that high levels of personal achievement are possible only if individuals are free to succeed or fail according to their individual merits.</strong></em><br><em><strong>What is your view of the relationship between equality and personal success?</strong></em></p>
<p>Faced with this question, here are 3 tips:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Have a strong opinion</strong> (e.g. I completely agree that people can achieve more in egalitarian societies.) You can ignore the other view.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on the last line of the question</strong> (What is your view of...?). This line sums up the whole question very clearly. Just answer this question.</li>
<li><strong>Use examples</strong> as the basis of your argument e.g. free university education ensures equality of opportunity, and therefore allows individuals to achieve more.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you try writing an essay for this question, you can compare your essay with my answer next Wednesday. I'm afraid I can't check essays or give scores.</p>
<p>Note: 'egalitarian' refers to the principle that people are equal, and deserve equal rights and opportunities.</p>

				<p><strong><em>Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school.<br>Discuss both views and give your opinion.</em></strong></p>
<p>Here's my full introduction and conclusion, as well as some ideas for the main body paragraphs:</p>
<p><strong>Introduction<br></strong>When they finish school, teenagers face the dilemma of whether to get a job or continue their education. While there are some benefits to getting a job straight after school, I would argue that it is better to go to college or university.</p>
<p><strong>Paragraph 1: benefits of getting a job<br></strong>The option to start work straight after school is attractive for several reasons.<br>(IDEAS: start earning money, become independent, gain experience, learn skills, get promotions, settle down earlier, afford a house, have a family)</p>
<p><strong>Paragraph 2: benefits of higher education (my opinion)<br></strong>On the other hand, I believe that it is more beneficial for students to continue their studies.<br>(IDEAS: some jobs require academic qualifications, better job opportunities, higher salaries, the job market is very competitive, gain knowledge, become a useful member of society)</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br>For the reasons mentioned above, it seems to me that students are more likely to be successful in their lives if they continue their studies beyond school level.</p>

				<p>Here's a 5-sentence paragraph using the second plan from <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2011/10/ielts-writing-5-sentence-paragraphs.html" target="_self">last week's lesson</a>:</p>
<p>Many people believe that sports professionals earn too much money. They argue that sport is a form of entertainment rather than a vital public service. We could easily live without sportspeople, yet other professionals who contribute much more to society are undervalued and underpaid. For example, football players can earn enormous salaries by simply kicking a ball, while doctors, nurses and teachers earn a fraction of the money despite being essential for our health and prosperity. From this perspective, sports stars do not deserve the salaries they currently earn.</p>
<p>As you can see, the paragraph explains the view that sportspeople earn too much money. This came from a&nbsp;<a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2011/06/ielts-writing-task-2-sports-salaries-topic.html" target="_self">discuss both views</a> question.</p>

				<p>Students often don't notice when a teacher corrects their mistakes.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Some IELTS writing task 2 questions ask: "Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?" or "Do the benefits outweigh the drawbacks?"</p>
<p>My advice for these questions is to write a paragraph about each side, and make it clear in the introduction and conclusion which side outweighs the other (i.e. your opinion about whether there are more advantages or disadvantages).</p>
<p>This was a recent exam question:</p>
<p><em><strong>In some countries, governments are encouraging industries and businesses to move to regional areas outside the big cities.</strong></em><br><em><strong>Do the advantages of this trend outweigh the disadvantages?</strong></em></p>
<p>Here are some ideas:</p>
<ol>
<li>Introduce the topic by paraphrasing the statement, then give a clear opinion about whether there are more advantages or disadvantages.</li>
<li>Advantages - e.g. costs are lower in regional areas; there is more space; provide jobs to boost deprived areas; avoid further overcrowding in cities.</li>
<li>Disadvantages - e.g. greater availability of skilled workers in big cities; better transport and infrastructure; companies based in regional areas are further from their clients, providers and other contacts.</li>
<li>Conclude by summarising your opinion in a different way.</li>

				<p>Last week I said that it's often easier to have a strong opinion and only support one side of the argument. Today I'm going to contradict myself! Let's look at a 'balanced opinion' essay.</p>
<p><em><strong>In the  last century, the first man to walk on the moon said it was "a giant  leap for mankind”. However, some people think it has made little difference  to our daily lives.</strong></em><br><em><strong>To what extent do you agree or disagree?</strong></em></p>

<ol>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Introduction</span>: I partly agree. Make it clear that you have a balanced opinion.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">One side</span>: In practical terms, sending a man to the moon has not changed most people's lives. We have not benefited in terms of our standard of living, health etc. In fact, governments have wasted a lot of money that could have been spent on public services.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Other side</span>: On the other hand, putting a man on the moon was a huge achievement that still inspires and interests people today. It showed us that we can achieve anything we put our minds to.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conclusion</span>: The fact that man has walked on the moon might not have had a direct effect on our daily lives, but it was an inspiring achievement.</li>

<li>You can talk about any type of book (textbook, biography etc.). You only need to describe a story if the question asks you to describe a 'novel'. </li>
<li>Many books are also films. It would be a good idea to prepare one description that you can use for both. </li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon.com</a> is great for reviews of books, films and music. Just search for a title, then go down the page to find the reviews. </li>
<li>"Steal" the best vocabulary from the reviews that you find. </li>
<li>Use Google. I searched for "my favourite film is" on Google and found this <a href="http://www.gumbopages.com/chuck/films.html">'My Favourite Films' website</a>. It's full of good ideas. </li>
<li>Try this Google search: "my favourite piece of music is" </li>
<li>You can describe a book, film or piece of music from your country. </li>
<li>You can invent a story if necessary, but it's easier to tell the truth. </li>
<li>If you don't like books, pretend that your favourite film is a book (and vice versa). </li>
<li>Remember to include adjectives to describe your feelings/opinions. Tell the story of when you first read the book, saw the film or listened to the song, who recommended it, why you like it etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>NB. 'Piece of music' just means a song.</p>

	<p>
				<p>The following question confuses many students because it doesn't seem to be one of the 3 normal types (opinion, discussion, problem/solution).</p>
<p><strong><em>Happiness is considered very important in life.<br>Why is it difficult to define?<br>What factors are important in achieving happiness?</em></strong></p>
<p>I call this a "2 part" question, and it's easier than you think. Just answer the first question in paragraph 2, and the second question in paragraph 3:</p>
<p><strong>1. Introduction - topic + simple answer to both questions<br></strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Paragraph - explain why happiness is difficult to define</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Some ideas:</span> Explain that happiness means different things to different people; the same situation can make one person happy but another person sad/bored etc. Give examples of what makes different people happy (money, success, family, friends, hobbies). Give an example from your experience e.g. a hobby that makes you happy but that your friend hates.</p>
<p><strong>3. Paragraph - give your opinions about how to achieve happiness</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Some ideas:</span> Try to organise your ideas logically - you could begin with humans' basic needs (in order to be happy we need to be healthy and have somewhere to live, food to eat etc.) then talk about the importance of family and friends. You could then write about career, money, success, status etc. - maybe you could explain that these things mean nothing if we do not have family and friends to share our experiences with. Give an example from your own life - what will make you happier than you are now?</p>
<p><strong>4. Conclusion - repeat/summarise the main ideas</strong></p>

	<p>
				<p>Here's my full essay using last week's plan:</p>
<p><em><strong>Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?</strong></em></p>
<p>In my opinion, men and women should have the same educational opportunities. However, I do not agree with the idea of accepting equal proportions of each gender in every university subject.</p>
<p>Having the same number of men and women on all degree courses is simply unrealistic. Student numbers on any course depend on the applications that the institution receives. If a university decided to fill courses with equal numbers of males and females, it would need enough applicants of each gender. In reality, many courses are more popular with one gender than the other, and it would not be practical to aim for equal proportions. For example, nursing courses tend to attract more female applicants, and it would be difficult to fill these courses if fifty per cent of the places needed to go to males.</p>
<p>Apart from the practical concerns expressed above, I also believe that it would be unfair to base admission to university courses on gender. Universities should continue to select the best candidates for each course according to their qualifications. In this way, both men and women have the same opportunities, and applicants know that they will be successful if they work hard to achieve good grades at school. If a female student is the best candidate for a place on a course, it is surely wrong to reject her in favour of a male student with lower grades or fewer qualifications.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the selection of university students should be based on merit, and it would be both impractical and unfair to change to a selection procedure based on gender.</p>

<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Paragraph 2</span>: One reason why we decided to disagree is that it would not be practical or realistic to have exactly the same number of males and females on every course. Some courses have mainly male applicants, while others are more popular with females.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Paragraph 3</span>: Another reason we disagreed is that it would not be fair to base admission to courses on gender. Universities should select candidates based on their qualifications, skills, experience etc.</li>

				<p>When deciding whether to give a band 7 in IELTS speaking or writing, one of the things that examiners look at is your use of collocations.</p>

<p>In my opinion, it is a bad idea to simply give financial aid to governments of poor countries. If rich countries do this, there is a risk that the money will not go to the people who need it most. Governments may misuse the money they are given because they do not have the resources or the know-how to tackle the causes of poverty. In some cases, corrupt politicians have become rich while their citizens continue to suffer. For these reasons, it is important for developed countries to find ways to invest in developing nations, instead of just donating money.</p>

	<p>
				<p><em><strong>Some people think that museums should be enjoyable places to entertain people, while others believe that the purpose of museums is to educate.</strong></em><br><em><strong>Discuss both views and give your own opinion.</strong></em></p>
<p>People have different views about the role and function of museums. In my opinion, museums can and should be both entertaining and educational.</p>
<p>On the one hand, it can be argued that the main role of a museum is to entertain. Museums are tourist attractions, and their aim is to exhibit a collection of interesting objects that many people will want to see. The average visitor may become bored if he or she has to read or listen to too much educational content, so museums often put more of an emphasis on enjoyment rather than learning. This type of museum is designed to be visually spectacular, and may have interactive activities or even games as part of its exhibitions.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some people argue that museums should focus on education. The aim of any exhibition should be to teach visitors something that they did not previously know. Usually this means that the history behind the museum’s exhibits needs to be explained, and this can be done in various ways. Some museums employ professional guides to talk to their visitors, while other museums offer headsets so that visitors can listen to detailed commentary about the exhibition. In this way, museums can play an important role in teaching people about history, culture, science and many other aspects of life.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it seems to me that a good museum should be able to offer an interesting, enjoyable and educational experience so that people can have fun and learn something at the same time.</p>

<li>Topic sentence to introduce the idea of gun control </li>
<li>risk of accidents, danger to children </li>
<li>more violent crimes, criminals will use guns, police will need guns </li>
<li>higher suicide rates </li>
<li>guns create violent societies </li>
</ol>
<p>Here's my paragraph using the ideas above. I've divided the paragraph into separate sentences so that you can see what I have done more clearly.</p>
<ol>
<li>In many countries, gun ownership is strictly controlled. </li>
<li>Supporters of this policy point out the risk of accidents with guns, especially when children can gain access to them. </li>
<li>They also argue that the number of violent crimes increases when guns are available, and that police are forced to use guns to combat armed criminals. </li>
<li>Furthermore, suicide rates have been shown to rise in places where guns are legal. </li>
<li>All in all, gun control advocates believe that guns create violent societies with high murder rates. </li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, in the IELTS exam you would probably have to explain the opposite view: the arguments in favour of gun ownership.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here's an example of how I write a 4-paragraph essay for "discuss and give your opinion" questions. Notice that I give my opinion in 3 places (introduction, paragraph 3, conclusion).</p>
<p><strong><em>Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school.<br>Discuss both views and give your opinion.</em></strong></p>
<p>When they finish school, teenagers face the dilemma of whether to get a job or continue their education. While there are some benefits to getting a job straight after school, I would argue that it is better to go to college or university.</p>
<p>The option to start work straight after school is attractive for several reasons. Many young people want to start earning money as soon as possible. In this way, they can become independent, and they will be able to afford their own house or start a family. In terms of their career, young people who decide to find work, rather than continue their studies, may progress more quickly. They will have the chance to gain real experience and learn practical skills related to their chosen profession. This may lead to promotions and a successful career.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I believe that it is more beneficial for students to continue their studies. Firstly, academic qualifications are required in many professions. For example, it is impossible to become a doctor, teacher or lawyer without having the relevant degree. As a result, university graduates have access to more and better job opportunities, and they tend to earn higher salaries than those with fewer qualifications. Secondly, the job market is becoming increasingly competitive, and sometimes there are hundreds of applicants for one position in a company. Young people who do not have qualifications from a university or college will not be able to compete.</p>
<p>For the reasons mentioned above, it seems to me that students are more likely to be successful in their careers if they continue their studies beyond school level.</p>

<p>My answer to this is "no, I don't think so".</p>
<p>Remember, you are not supposed to need any specific knowledge for the IELTS exam. I've never seen any questions about current political events or specific news stories.

	<p>
				<p><em><strong>As most people spend a major part of their adult life at work, job satisfaction is an important element of individual well-being.</strong></em><br><em><strong>What factors contribute to job satisfaction?</strong></em><br><em><strong>How realistic is the expectation of job satisfaction for all workers?</strong></em></p>
<p>The following paragraph answers the second part of the question (How realistic..)</p>
<p>It is difficult to imagine a world in which everyone is truly satisfied with their job. Most people work in order to earn a salary, and they would probably not choose to spend eight or more hours each day doing their jobs if they did not need the money. The need to earn money to pay mortgages, bills and everyday living costs is of much greater concern than job satisfaction. In fact, I would argue that the majority of people dislike their jobs and are unhappy about their salaries, working hours, workloads, or their bosses.</p>

	<p>
				<p>The following question was used in several countries last Saturday. I've listed some ideas below.</p>
<p><em><strong>Some people think that in the modern world we have become more dependent on each other, while others think that people are now more independent. </strong></em><br><em><strong>Discuss both views and give your own opinion.</strong></em></p>
<p>First view: we have become more dependent</p>
<ul>
<li>Life is more difficult and expensive, and we are less self-sufficient</li>
<li>Young people rely on their parents for longer</li>
<li>Unemployed people receive state benefits</li>
<li>Our jobs are much more specialised, and we need to work in teams</li>
</ul>
<p>Second view: we are more independent</p>
<ul>
<li>We rely on machines more than we depend on each other</li>
<li>The Internet allows us to solve problems without needing help</li>
<li>Families are more dispersed, and therefore provide less support</li>
<li>Education gives us the freedom to make our own choices</li>
</ul>
<p>By linking these points together and supporting them with examples, you could easily write two good paragraphs.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Today, I'd like to share a 'band 9' sample essay for the question below.</p>
<p><em><strong>Several languages are in danger of extinction because they are spoken by very small numbers of people. Some people say that governments should spend public money on saving these languages, while others believe that would be a waste of money.</strong></em><br><em><strong>Discuss both these views and give your opinion.</strong></em></p>
<p>It is true that some minority languages may disappear in the near future. Although it can be argued that governments could save money by allowing this to happen, I believe that these languages should be protected and preserved.</p>
<p>There are several reasons why saving minority languages could be seen as a waste of money. Firstly, if a language is only spoken by a small number of people, expensive education programmes will be needed to make sure that more people learn it, and the state will have to pay for facilities, teachers and marketing. This money might be better spent on other public services. Secondly, it would be much cheaper and more efficient for countries to have just one language. Governments could cut all kinds of costs related to communicating with each minority group.</p>
<p>Despite the above arguments, I believe that governments should try to preserve languages that are less widely spoken. A language is much more than simply a means of communication; it has a vital connection with the cultural identity of the people who speak it. If a language disappears, a whole way of life will disappear with it, and we will lose the rich cultural diversity that makes societies more interesting. By spending money to protect minority languages, governments can also preserve traditions, customs and behaviours that are part of a country’s history.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it may save money in the short term if we allow minority languages to disappear, but in the long term this would have an extremely negative impact on our cultural heritage.</p>

<p><strong>2. First reason why I agree: equal opportunities</strong><br>Explain why women should have the same right as men to choose their profession. People should be chosen for jobs according to their skills, qualifications, character etc.</p>
<p><strong>3. Second reason why I agree: women's capabilities</strong><br>I would disagree with the view that women are less able than men to do certain jobs. Also, I would argue that policewomen, for example, may be better at controlling a situation by communicating more effectively. Police and military work requires more than just physical strength. Teamwork, leadership and communication can be much more important.</p>

				<p>This was a recent IELTS exam question:</p>
<p><em><strong>Online shopping is increasing dramatically. How could this trend affect our environment and the kinds of&nbsp;jobs required?</strong></em></p>
<p>My advice is to plan your essay with a 4-paragraph structure:</p>
<p><strong>1. Introduction: topic + response (2 sentences are enough)</strong><br>Introduce the topic of 'online shopping becoming more popular'. Then write that it will have a significant impact on the environment and on jobs.</p>
<p><strong>2. Paragraph about the environment</strong><br>Write about simple ideas e.g. people will drive less, so there will be less pollution, less destruction from the building of new roads, but perhaps more packaging.</p>
<p><strong>3. Paragraph about jobs</strong><br>Simple ideas e.g. many shop workers will lose their jobs, unemployment may rise, but there will be more skilled jobs in IT (computer programmers, web designers).</p>
<p><strong>4. Conclusion: repeat your response</strong><br>Overall opinion: online shopping may have a negative effect on employment, but it might be a good thing for the environment.</p>

	<h4><a href="https://www.ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2010/12/ielts-writing-task-2-fixed-punishments.html">IELTS Writing Task 2: fixed punishments</a></h4>
	<p>
				<p><em>Some people believe that there should be fixed punishments for each type of crime. Others, however, argue that the circumstances of an individual crime, and the motivation for committing it, should always be taken into account when deciding on the punishment.</em><em> Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.</em></p>
<p>Here is my suggested essay outline:</p>
<p><strong>1. Introduction: topic + response</strong></p>
<p>People have different views about whether punishments for crimes should be fixed. Although there are some advantages of fixed punishments, I believe that it is better to judge each crime individually.</p>
<p><strong>2. Benefits of fixed punishments</strong></p>
<p>There are some good arguments for having one set punishment for each crime.<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">IDEAS</span>: easy, fair justice system; everyone is aware of the punishment for each crime; fixed punishments could deter criminals.</p>
<p><strong>3. Benefits of not having fixed punishments</strong></p>
<p>However, I would argue that the circumstances of a crime and the criminal’s motivation should have an influence on the punishment.<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">IDEAS</span>: judge can decide the best response; a more humane system; example: stealing to feed a family compared to stealing for profit.</p>
<p><strong>4. Conclusion: repeat your response</strong></p>
<p>In conclusion, despite the advantages of fixed punishments, it seems to me that each crime should be judged taking both the circumstances and motivation into account.</p>

<li><strong><em>While</em></strong> and <strong><em>whilst</em></strong> are the same, but <strong><em>whilst</em></strong> is a bit more formal (according to one famous grammar book).</li>
<li><strong><em>Whereas</em></strong> is always used for contrast. <strong><em>While/whilst</em></strong> can be used for contrast, OR to mean "at the same time".</li>

	<p>
				<p>A lot of IELTS Writing questions ask you to give opinions about what governments should do in relation to an issue. Governments can have an influence on almost everything: environment, crime, television, advertising, work etc.</p>
<p>As part of your IELTS preparation, you should think about what governments can do in relation to IELTS topics. Here are some ideas from my ebook:</p>
<ul>
<li>Governments provide public services like healthcare and education.</li>
<li>They introduce new laws.</li>
<li>They raise money by taxing working people.</li>
<li>They can spend money on campaigns to educate people.</li>
<li>They can raise people's awareness of issues.</li>
<li>They can create new jobs.</li>
<li>They can provide resources for schools, hospitals etc.</li>
<li>They can support people who are living in poverty or unable to work.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, if the question asks you to suggest what governments should do to reduce obesity, you could write this:</p>
<p>"In my opinion, governments should spend money on campaigns to educate people about the importance of regular exercise and a healthy diet. Perhaps they should also introduce new laws to ban the advertising of junk food to children."</p>
<p>Think about some other IELTS topics. What do you think governments should do?</p>

	<p>
				<p>When I was working as an examiner, I noticed that many students <em><strong>overuse</strong></em> 'moreover', 'furthermore' and 'in addition'. Some students seem to think that using these linking words will help them to get a 7. This is wrong.</p>
<p>Don't overuse these words. Although they can be useful, you should not begin every sentence with one of them. Use them occasionally.</p>
<p>Remember, all IELTS students learn linking words like 'moreover', so examiners are not impressed by them. If you want to impress the examiner, you need to use good vocabulary related to the question topic.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em><br>Don't forget to use the word 'and'. As a native speaker, I probably use 'and' much more than any other linking word.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here is a question that a student asked me about:</p>
<p><em><strong>Some people believe that the range of technology available to individuals today is increasing the gap between rich people and poor people, while others say that technology has the opposite effect. Discuss both views and give your opinion.</strong></em></p>
<p>I'd write a 4-paragraph essay:</p>
<ol>
<li>Introduction: introduce the topic and give your view</li>
<li>One view</li>
<li>The other view (that you agree with)</li>
<li>Conclusion: repeat your view</li>
</ol>
<p>Some ideas:</p>
<p>Technology could increase the gap between rich and poor. Rich people have smartphones, laptops, wireless broadband Internet etc. People in developed countries can now work from home or from anywhere in the world. They can do their shopping online and have things delivered to their homes. Technology improves their quality of life.</p>
<p>On the other hand, many people in poorer countries, who did not have normal telephones, now have mobile phones. Also, the Internet is spreading to all parts of the world. In the past, only people in developed countries had access to world-class libraries, but now the Internet gives everyone access to the same information. This will lead to greater equality.</p>

				<p>Last week I looked at how to use the word 'because'. One of my students then asked me to explain the difference between 'because' and 'because of'.</p>
<p>Compare these two sentences:</p>

<p>The important difference is the use of the word 'was' in the first sentence. After 'because', you need a subject and a verb (e.g. the weather was). After 'because of', we don't use a verb, only a noun, nouns or noun phrase.</p>

				<p>The speaker in yesterday's video gave the positives of English as a global second language. Here is a paragraph with arguments against this view.</p>
<p><strong>Negatives of English as a global language:</strong><br>The expansion of English has also been criticised. Some people worry that if one language, like English, becomes dominant, other languages may disappear. Languages spoken by small communities could become extinct as people learn English in order to find work. This would obviously have a negative effect on local cultures, customs and traditions because the new dominant language would bring its own culture with it. For example, the expansion of English has happened alongside the increasing popularity of American culture. The American film, music and fashion industries are as dominant as global American companies and products, such as Microsoft or the iPod. Some people call this ‘cultural imperialism’, meaning that one culture has power over others.</p>
<p><strong>Try to analyse this paragraph</strong><br>Is there a topic sentence? What reasons and examples are given? What linking expressions are used? What 'band 7 vocabulary' is used? Can you find some conditional sentences?</p>

				<p><em><strong>Do the benefits of tourism outweigh the drawbacks?</strong></em></p>
<p>Here are some ideas. I've organised the vocabulary according to different perspectives (different ways of looking at this issue).</p>
<p>Positives of tourism:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Personal perspective:</strong> Tourism is a popular leisure activity. Tourists can relax, have fun, 'recharge their batteries', experience different customs and cultures (sight-seeing, sunbathing, visiting monuments, tasting new cuisine). Travel opens our minds. It can broaden our horizons.</li>
<li><strong>Economic perspective:</strong> The tourism industry is vital for some countries. People rely on tourism for their income. Tourism attracts investment from governments and companies. It creates employment due to demand for goods and services (hotels, entertainment etc.). It helps to improve the standard of living.</li>
</ol>
<p>Negatives of tourism:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Environmental perspective:</strong> Tourism can have a negative impact on the environment. Excessive building (roads, hotels etc.) destroys natural habitats and spoils the landscape. Tourism creates pollution and waste. It puts pressure on local resources such as food, water and energy.</li>
<li><strong>Economic perspective: </strong>Tourism may cause a rise in the cost of living. Prices of goods and services go up. Tourists buy second homes. All of this affects local people.</li>
<li><strong>Cultural perspective:</strong> Local traditions may be lost. Traditional jobs and skills die out (e.g. farming, fishing). Local people are forced to work in the tourist industry.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thinking about topics from different perspectives can help you to generate better ideas. This technique isn't perfect for every topic, but it can be really useful.</p>

<li>Companies need to tell customers about their products and services.</li>
<li>Advertisements inform us about the choices we have.</li>
<li>The advertising industry employs many people.</li>
<li>Advertisements are often funny, artistic or thought-provoking.</li>

<ul>
<li>Advertisers aim to convince us that buying things leads to happiness.</li>

<p>Yesterday's video contained some useful ideas, but here are some more ideas from my ebook:</p>
<p>Positives of globalisation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Business is becoming increasingly international.</li>
<li>A global economy means free trade between countries.</li>
<li>This can strengthen political relationships.</li>
<li>Globalisation can also create opportunities for employment.</li>
<li>It encourages investment in less developed countries.</li>
<li>It could reduce poverty in the developing world.</li>
</ul>
<p>Negatives of globalisation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Globalisation can also lead to unemployment and exploitation.</li>
<li>Companies move to countries where labour is cheap.</li>
<li>This creates redundancies, or job losses.</li>
<li>Some companies exploit their employees in developing countries.</li>
<li>Salaries are low and working conditions are often poor.</li>

				<p>Several students have asked me to help them with this IELTS question:</p>

<p><em><strong>Some people think that school children need to learn practical skills such as car maintenance or bank account management along with the academic subjects at school. To what extent do you agree or disagree?</strong></em></p>

<p>Here are some suggestions (this is NOT an essay):</p>

<p><strong>1. Introduce the topic then give your opinion</strong><br>I would write that it is true that children learn academic subjects at school, but not many practical skills. However, I would then disagree that schools should teach skills like bank account management and car maintenance.</p>

<p><strong>2. First supporting paragraph</strong><br>I would write a paragraph about the importance of academic subjects like maths, science, languages etc. We live in a knowledge-based economy where independent thinking and problem solving are the most important skills. With timetables already full, schools do not have time to teach children anything else.</p>

<p><strong>3. Second supporting paragraph</strong><br>I would argue that bank account management is a 'life skill' that anyone can learn by simply opening a bank account. Most adults have no problem managing their finances without being taught accounting lessons at school. Other skills like car maintenance are not really necessary. Most people take their cars to a qualified mechanic.</p>

<p><strong>4. Conclusion</strong><br>Repeat the idea that schools are already doing a good job teaching the traditional academic subjects. If they start to teach practical skills, the study of important academic subjects will suffer.</p>

<p>Positives of keeping animals in zoos:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Environmental perspective:</strong> Zoos play an important role in wildlife conservation. They help to protect endangered species. They allow scientists to study animal behaviour.</li>
<li><strong>Economic perspective:</strong> Zoos employ large numbers of people. They provide job opportunities and income for the local area. The money raised can be used for conservation projects.</li>
<li><strong>Personal perspective:</strong> Zoos are interesting, educational and fun. They make a great day out for families. Children learn to appreciate wildlife and nature.</li>
</ol>
<p>Negatives of zoos:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Environmental perspective:</strong> Zoos are artificial environments. Animals lose their instinct to hunt for food. It would be better to save endangered species by protecting their natural habitats.</li>
<li><strong>Moral perspective:</strong> Keeping animals in cages is unethical. We have no right to use animals for entertainment. Zoos exhibit animals with the aim of making a profit.</li>

	<p>
				<p>Some students get angry with the IELTS exam. They disagree with the exam format, or they think that examiners are too strict. They often want to suggest their own improvements.</p>

<p>I completely understand that such an important exam can be frustrating, and I agree that the IELTS exam is not perfect. However, I also think that too much worrying is a waste of time.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the exam is what it is. We have to accept that, and work hard to overcome the difficulties. You <em><strong>will</strong></em> pass the exam if you apply yourself, follow advice, and study hard.</p>

	<p>
				<p>These two words are the opposites of 'rise' and 'raise' (see last week's grammar lesson):</p>

<ul>
<li>something falls (e.g. the price fell)</li>
<li>somebody reduces something (e.g. the company reduced the price)</li>
</ul>
<p>You will probably use 'fall' to describe numbers on a graph or chart for IELTS Writing Task 1:</p>

<ul>
<li>In 2008, the number of customers fell. (verb, past)</li>
<li>There was a sharp fall in Internet usage. (noun)</li>
</ul>
<p>'Reduce' and 'reduction' are probably more useful for Writing Task 2:</p>

<ul>
<li>We need to reduce the amount of pollution from exhaust fumes. (verb)</li>
<li>Recycling leads to a reduction in waste. (noun)</li>
</ul>

	<p>
				<p>Here is a "problem/solution" question, with some ideas for an essay below:</p>

<p><em><strong>Many criminals re-offend after they have been punished. Why do some people continue to commit crimes after they have been punished, and what measures can be taken to tackle this problem?</strong></em></p>

<p>Causes of crime and re-offending:</p>

<ul>
<li>The main causes of crime are poverty, unemployment and lack of education.</li>
<li>People who commit crimes often have no other way of making a living.</li>
<li>The prison system can make the situation worse.</li>
<li>Offenders mix with other criminals who can be a negative influence.</li>
<li>A criminal record makes finding a job more difficult.</li>
<li>Many prisoners re-offend when they are released.</li>
</ul>
<p>Possible measures to reduce crime and re-offending:</p>

<ul>
<li>Prisons should provide education or vocational training.</li>
<li>Rehabilitation programmes prepare prisoners for release into society.</li>
<li>Community service is another way to reform offenders.</li>
<li>It makes offenders useful in their local communities.</li>
<li>They might be required to talk to school groups or clean public areas.</li>
<li>Offenders also need help when looking for accommodation and work.</li>
</ul>

	<p>
				<p>Usually I suggest writing 4 paragraphs for task 2. However, sometimes it might be better to write 5 paragraphs. The following essay question has three parts, so I've written three main body paragraphs (5 paragraphs in total).</p>

<p><em><strong>Explain some of the ways in which humans are damaging the environment. What can governments do to address these problems? What can individual people do?</strong></em></p>

<p>Humans are responsible for a variety of environmental problems, but we can also take steps to reduce the damage that we are causing to the planet. This essay will discuss environmental problems and the measures that governments and individuals can take to address these problems.</p>

<p>Two of the biggest threats to the environment are air pollution and waste. Gas emissions from factories and exhaust fumes from vehicles lead to global warming, which may have a devastating effect on the planet in the future. As the human population increases, we are also producing ever greater quantities of waste, which contaminates the earth and pollutes rivers and oceans.</p>

<p>Governments could certainly make more effort to reduce air pollution. They could introduce laws to limit emissions from factories or to force companies to use renewable energy from solar, wind or water power. They could also impose ‘green taxes’ on drivers and airline companies. In this way, people would be encouraged to use public transport and to take fewer flights abroad, therefore reducing emissions.</p>

<p>Individuals should also take responsibility for the impact they have on the environment. They can take public transport rather than driving, choose products with less packaging, and recycle as much as possible. Most supermarkets now provide reusable bags for shoppers as well as ‘banks’ for recycling glass, plastic and paper in their car parks. By reusing and recycling, we can help to reduce waste.</p>

<p>In conclusion, both national governments and individuals must play their part in looking after the environment.</p>

<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em><br>This essay is exactly 250 words long. I've tried to make it as simple as possible, but it's still good enough to get a band 9.</p>

	<p>
				<p>After you introduction (see last week's lesson) you need to write 2 or 3 main body paragraphs. This is the most important part of your essay.</p>

<p>If you have been following this blog for a while, or if you have bought my ebook, you may have seen today's paragraph before. However, I'm reusing it for 2 reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>It's a great example of how to write an "advantages" paragraph using a "firstly, secondly, finally" structure.</li>
<li>There are some excellent comments from students below this lesson. If you read them carefully, you will learn a lot.</li>
</ol>
<em><strong>Main body "advantages" paragraph (band 9):</strong></em><br>
<p>There are several advantages to using computers in education. <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">Firstly,</span> students learn new skills which will be extremely useful for their future jobs. For example, they learn to write reports or other documents using a word processor, and they can practise doing spoken presentations using PowerPoint slides. <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">Secondly,</span> technology is a powerful tool to engage students. The use of websites or online videos can make lessons much more interesting, and many students are more motivated to do homework or research using online resources. <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">Finally,</span> if each student has a computer to work on, they can study at their own pace.</p>

	<p>
				<p>For IELTS Writing Task 2, keep your introduction short and simple. Don't waste time writing a long introduction; the main body paragraphs are more important.</p>

<p><em><strong>A good IELTS Writing introduction needs only 2 things:</strong></em></p>

<ol>
<li>A sentence that introduces the topic</li>
<li>A sentence that gives a short, general answer to the question
</li>
</ol>
<p><em><strong>Here is an example of an IELTS Task 2 question:</strong></em></p>

<p>As computers are being used more and more in education, there will soon be no role for the teacher in the classroom. To what extent do you agree or disagree?</p>

<p><em><strong>Here is my introduction:</strong></em></p>

<p>It is true that computers have become an essential tool for teachers and students in all areas of education. However, while computers are extremely useful, I do not agree with the idea that they could soon replace teachers completely.</p>

<ol>
<li>In the first sentence I introduce the topic of computers in education.</li>
<li>In the second sentence I answer the question and make my opinion clear. Don't wait until the conclusion to give your opinion.</li>
</ol>

<p>Remember, do a simple introduction, then you can focus on the main paragraphs.</p>

	<p>
				<p><em><strong>Many people believe that parents are not as close to their children as they used to be. Suggest some reasons why this could be true.</strong></em></p>

<p>Here is an example paragraph about the above topic:</p>

<p>Parents and their children seem to be less close nowadays. Perhaps the main reason for this is that both parents often work full-time and therefore spend less time with their children. Whereas women traditionally stayed at home to cook, clean and look after children, many mothers now choose to work or are forced to do so. This means that children may be left alone, or with nannies or babysitters. Busy parents have less contact with their children and less energy to enjoy family activities. Many families no longer eat meals together, and children are given the freedom to go out with friends, watch television or chat on the Internet for hours.</p><p><em><strong>Please note:</strong></em><br>A full IELTS question would also ask you to suggest how families could become closer.</p>

<p>Some people believe that, all police officers should carry a gun. While, others disagree with this idea, and argue that it is intimidating to see armed police officers on the streets.

	<p>
				<p>What are the benefits and drawbacks of immigration or multi-cultural societies?</p>

<p><strong>Here is a paragraph giving some of the economic benefits of immigration:</strong></p>

<p>From an economic perspective, immigration can be extremely positive. Many immigrants have skills that are needed in the country they move to. For example, countries sometimes lack key workers like doctors and nurses, and immigration is therefore encouraged. Immigrants who find work contribute to the economy of their new country with the skills they bring and the taxes they pay. At the same time, many immigrants send money to help family members in their home country, therefore helping to boost that economy too.</p>

<p><strong>Can you think of any social benefits of immigration? Are there any economic or social disadvantages?</strong></p>

<p>PS. I'll send a few extra paragraphs about this topic to people on my email list (people who have bought the <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/ielts-ebook.html">ebook</a>). </p>

	<p>
				<p>A recent IELTS Writing Task 2 question was about the advantages and disadvantages of private healthcare. Here are some ideas from my <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/ielts-ebook.html#tp">ebook</a>:</p>
<p><strong>State Health Systems: Advantages</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Good healthcare should be available to everyone for free.</li>
<li>State healthcare is paid by the government using money from taxes.</li>
<li>Everyone has access to the same quality of care and treatment.</li>
<li>Private healthcare is unfair because only wealthy people can afford it.</li>
<li>The National Health Service in the UK provides free healthcare for every resident. (use this as an example)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Private Healthcare: Advantages</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>State hospitals are often very large and difficult to run.</li>
<li>Private hospitals have shorter waiting lists for operations and appointments.</li>
<li>Patients can benefit from faster treatment.</li>
<li>Many people prefer to pay for a more personal service.</li>
<li>Patients have their own room and more comfortable facilities.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Note:<br></em></strong>You can use the advantages of state healthcare when discussing the disadvantages of private healthcare.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Today I asked my students about the vegetarianism topic. They found it quite difficult to give both sides of the argument. It's important to be able to discuss both sides of an issue, even if there are points that you don't agree with.</p>

<p><strong>Here is a summary of the arguments in favour of a vegetarian diet, according to the speaker in yesterday's video:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>A vegetarian diet is healthier.</li>
<li>Eating a hamburger a day can increase your risk of dying by a third.</li>
<li>Raising animals in factory farm conditions is cruel.</li>
<li>Meat production causes more emissions than transportation.</li>
<li>Beef production uses 100 times the amount of water that vegetable production requires.</li>
<li>A vegetarian diet is cheaper.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, basically he is saying that a vegetarian diet is healthier, kinder to animals, better for the environment and cheaper.</p>

<p><strong>Now you need to think about the opposite argument. Feel free to discuss your ideas in the "comments" area.</strong></p>

				<p>Today I'd like to show you a good essay by one of my students. This is the essay question:</p>

<p><em><strong>Traffic congestion is becoming a huge problem for many major cities. Suggest some measures that could be taken to reduce traffic in big cities.</strong></em></p>
