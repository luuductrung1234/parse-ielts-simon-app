	<p>
				<p>As I'm sure you know, we normally place the adjective in front of the noun in English e.g. "the red car" instead of "the car red".</p>
<p>However, English is a crazy language, and rules are there to be broken!</p>
<p>If you read yesterday's lesson (and clicked on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postpositive_adjective">this link</a>), you may have seen the following examples of noun + adjective:</p>
<ul>
<li>someone important</li>
<li>somewhere nice</li>
<li>the best <em><strong>room available</strong></em></li>
<li>the only <em><strong>decision possible</strong></em></li>
<li>the worst <em><strong>choice imaginable</strong></em></li>
<li>the <em><strong>person responsible</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Remember:</strong> The 'rules' that you find in an intermediate (or even 'advanced') grammar book are probably a simplification. There are deeper levels to be discovered!<br></p>

	<h4><a href="https://www.ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2020/02/ielts-grammar-any-product-imaginable.html">IELTS Grammar: 'any product imaginable'</a></h4>
	<p>
				<p>There was an interesting discussion in the comments below Wednesday's <a href="https://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2020/02/ielts-writing-task-2-from-plan-to-paragraph.html">lesson</a> about the phrase <em><strong>"I can buy any product imaginable"</strong></em>.</p>
<p>Here's a summary of the questions in that discussion:</p>
<p>1) Why did I write <em><strong>any product <span style="text-decoration: underline;">imaginable</span></strong></em> instead of <strong><em>any</em> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">imaginable</span> product</strong>?<br>2) Would <em><strong>any imaginable product</strong></em> also be correct?<br>3) Is there a difference in meaning between the two phrases?</p>
<p>I'll try to answer without going deep into grammar, but if you really like the grammar side of things, have a look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postpositive_adjective">this page</a> (especially the part about 'the only decision possible' and 'the worst choice imaginable').</p>
<ol>
<li>The simple answer is that "any product imaginable" sounds better to me as a native speaker. This phrase isn't my own original creation; I've probably heard or read it many times in similar contexts, so it's the instinctive phrase to use.<br><strong>Note:</strong> There are 14,300 Google search results for this collocation.</li>
<li>While "any imaginable product" is also grammatically correct, it seems just a little less natural to me. The emphasis is slightly different, and the meaning could also be understood in a slightly different way.<br><strong>Note:</strong> There are only 905 Google search results for this collocation.</li>
<li>This is debatable. If I had to give you my view, I would say that an "imaginable product" could include products that don't currently exist (e.g. a flying car), whereas my phrase "any product imaginable" tends to refer to products that currently exist.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the end, the Google results and my instinct as a native speaker are probably your best guide. In normal English usage, "any product imaginable" is the typical collocation.</p>

	<p>
				<p>All students learn to link ideas using words like "however", "furthermore" etc. Most students don't realise that the word "this" is also a linking word. Look at the following examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nowadays, people can use the Internet to work from home. In <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">this</span> way, people who do not have access to transport can find employment.</li>
<li>Most products are built to last only a short time, and <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">this</span> creates a "throw-away" culture.</li>
<li>A global economy means free trade between countries. <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">This</span> can strengthen political relationships.</li>
</ul>
<p>The word "this" refers to the sentence or idea that came before. "This" helps you to link ideas and avoid repetition. Native speakers and good writers use "this" a lot, and the IELTS examiner will be impressed if you can use it.</p>

	<p>
				<p><strong>An IELTS teacher asked me the following questions:</strong></p>
<p><em>Is it compulsory for candidates to address all of the prompts on the cue card? What happens if candidates ignore the prompts but speak well about the topic anyway? And what happens if the candidate misunderstands the question and speaks about a different topic?</em></p>
<p><strong>Here are the answers that I gave the teacher:</strong></p>
<p>I tell my students to use the prompts because they help you to structure your answer. However, it is still possible to get a very high score even if you don't address all of the points e.g. if you speak well about the topic but miss the last point or two. I don't recommend ignoring the points completely, because there's a danger that you'll go off task if you do that.</p>
<p>If you misunderstand the question and give an unrelated answer, I'm afraid you'll get a very low score. The reason is that candidates could memorise a perfect answer if off-topic answers were allowed.</p>

	<p>
				<p>I studied French at school for seven years, and my teachers helped me to accumulate quite a lot of <em><strong>knowledge about</strong></em> the language.</p>
<p>However, when I visited France I still felt like a beginner. I found it difficult to understand native speakers, and I couldn't speak naturally; I had to construct sentences in my head before I spoke, and I was constantly worried about making mistakes. In short, I had knowledge but <strong><em>not much skill</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Do you feel like this when you speak or write in English? Maybe it's time to stop <em><strong>studying</strong></em> English and start <em><strong>practising</strong></em> it as much as possible!</p>

	<p>
				<p>Look at the following question and my sample answer, in which I've highlighted the adjectives.</p>
<p><em><strong><span style="caret-color: #000000; color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; -moz-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; text-decoration: none; display: inline !important; float: none;">What do you think are the characteristics of a good speaker?</span></strong></em></p>

They need to be <strong>interesting</strong> and <strong>engaging</strong>. I think a speaker's body language is also really <strong>important</strong>. A famous example of a <strong>great</strong> speaker is Barack Obama; he seems to be a naturally <strong>inspiring</strong> speaker, but I'm sure that practice and preparation are more important than <strong>natural</strong> talent.</span></p>

	<p>
				<p>You won't have time to do this in your test, but it's a good idea to edit and improve the essays that you write at home.</p>
<p>For example, in the <a href="https://www.ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2020/01/ielts-writing-task-2-music-essay.html">music essay</a> that I shared on Wednesday, there's a phrase that we could improve: <strong>"the planet's global language"</strong>.</p>
<p>While this phrase is fine and wouldn't affect the essay's score, you could argue that it contains repetition because 'planet' and 'global' communicate similar meanings. Note: We could simply write "the planet's language" or "the global language", but I wanted to use this structure: noun + adjective + language.</p>
<p>So let's think about some possible alternatives:</p>
<ol>
<li>the planet's shared language</li>
<li>the planet's common language</li>
<li>humanity's global language</li>
<li>our global language</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice that I changed the adjective 'global' in the first two examples, I used a different noun (humanity) in example 3, and I used a pronoun instead of the noun 'planet' in example 4. Which alternative do you prefer?</p>

<p><strong>Here's the answer that I gave the student:</strong></p>
<p>I know it seems strange, but this is a common way to ask for something in English. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>I was hoping that you could help me = I hope you can help me.</li>
<li>I was hoping to get your advice = Can you give me your advice?</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps you could think about it like this: the "hoping" happened in my head before I decided to ask for the help.</p>
<p>Or you could just see this as a fixed phrase, and a typically English way to ask politely and indirectly!</p>

				<ol>
<li>What technology or equipment is used in most workplaces nowadays?</li>
<li>Does technology help workers or make their lives more difficult?</li>
<li>What effect does new technology have on employment?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>1. Tip: give a list of different technologies, then talk about one in detail:</strong></p>
<p>In most workplaces people use equipment such as computers, phones, printers, fax machines and photocopiers. I think the computer is probably the most essential piece of equipment because we rely on it for almost everything: communicating by email, writing reports, organising data, and finding information on the Internet.</p>
<p><strong>2. Tip: talk about the positives AND the negatives:</strong></p>
<p>Technology definitely helps workers because it makes many tasks so much easier. For example, email is such a useful tool for communication between employees in different offices, or even in different countries. On the other hand, technology can make life more difficult, especially when it goes wrong. It causes a lot of stress when the Internet is down or a computer crashes.</p>
<p><strong>3. Tip: give the good effects AND the bad effects:</strong></p>
<p>I think technology is often responsible for people losing their jobs. Machines have replaced people in areas like manufacturing and agriculture, and whenever a new technology is introduced, there are redundancies. At the same time, jobs might be created thanks to a new technology; for example, there would be no computer programmers if the computer hadn't been invented.</p>

<p><strong><em>But this isn't necessarily correct</em></strong>. First, long sentences are just short sentences (or clauses) that have been linked together, so it's not difficult to write them. Second, you won't get a high score if your long sentences are full of mistakes.</p>
<p>The best writers use a mix of <em><strong>long and short</strong></em> sentences. This is the ideal style to aim for because it makes your writing 'smoother', more varied, and easier to read.</p>

	<h4><a href="https://www.ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2020/01/ielts-speaking-part-2-describe-a-place.html">IELTS Speaking Part 2: describe a place</a></h4>
	<p>
				<p>In part 2 of the speaking test, you might have to describe a place. There are several possible questions about places. For example:</p>
<ol>
<li>Describe a place you have visited.</li>
<li>Describe a historic place.</li>
<li>Describe a holiday.</li>
<li>Describe a place you would like to visit.</li>
<li>Describe somewhere you have lived or would like to live.</li>
</ol>
<p>My advice is to prepare a description of one place that you could use to answer all of these questions. Then search the Internet for some good vocabulary.</p>
<p>For example, here are some ideas I found to describe London:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Adjectives:</strong> it's exciting, busy, hectic, cosmopolitan, multicultural, unique. It's historic but modern at the same time, it's a thriving, prosperous city, it's fashionable, lively, fun...</li>
<li><strong>Activities:</strong> London is famous for its history, culture, art, museums. Tourists go there to see Big Ben, The Tower of London, Buckingham Palace, Trafalgar Square etc. You can get a fantastic view of the city from the 'London Eye'. It's also famous for its theatres and shows in the West End, its shops, restaurants and nightlife. There are endless things to see and do.</li>
<li><strong>Negatives:</strong> London is expensive, crowded, stressful, polluted. The underground system is dirty, travel is overpriced and unpleasant. The cost of living is high (shopping, house prices etc.), the locals are always in a hurry and can be unfriendly, there are social problems (like you can find in most big cities).</li>
</ul>

				<p>If you want to make tangible progress every day, aim to do <em><strong>one</strong></em> of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Analyse <em><strong>one</strong></em> grammar or vocabulary mistake that you made, and understand the correction.</li>
<li>Analyse <em><strong>one</strong></em> mistake in a reading or listening test, and understand why you got the answer wrong.</li>
<li>Learn <em><strong>one</strong></em> new word, collocation or phrase.</li>
<li>Learn how to express <em><strong>one</strong></em> idea in a 'natural' way. Find out how a native speaker would say it.</li>
<li>Prepare ideas, opinions and vocabulary for <em><strong>one</strong></em> IELTS topic.</li>
<li>Read <em><strong>one</strong></em> sample band 9 essay, and highlight anything useful e.g. vocabulary, cohesive devices, how ideas are developed.</li>
<li>Write <em><strong>one</strong></em> paragraph and get it checked by a teacher.</li>
<li>Record yourself doing <em><strong>one</strong></em> speaking test. Transcribe the recording and analyse the transcription or get it checked by a teacher.</li>
</ol>
<p>I could add more points, but I'm sure you get the idea. Just do <em><strong>one</strong></em> thing that feels like real progress every day. Imagine where you'll be after 100 days!</p>

				<p>Preparing for a test can become boring and repetitive. To keep things interesting, I recommend that you try something new from time to time.</p>
<p>I'm not suggesting that you should change your <em><strong>whole</strong></em> approach to the IELTS test. Just find ways to <strong><em>add variety</em></strong> to your study plan.</p>
<p>For example, you could</p>
<ul>
<li>work on a different aspect of your writing e.g. coherence</li>
<li>record yourself speaking and listen to your hesitations</li>
<li>analyse the correct answers to a reading test, instead of doing the test</li>

	<p>
				<p>If you look at the 'fluency and coherence' column of the band descriptors, you'll see the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Band 7:</strong> may demonstrate <em><strong>language-related</strong></em> hesitation</li>
<li><strong>Band 8:</strong> hesitation is usually <em><strong>content-related</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p>Do you understand the difference between these two types of hesitation? Here's how I would summarise them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Language-related hesitation: the candidate pauses because he/she is struggling with vocabulary or grammar.</li>
<li>Content-related hesitation: the candidate pauses to think about his/her answer to the question.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Try recording yourself as you answer some IELTS speaking questions. Listen to the recording and pay attention to your hesitations. Ask yourself whether you paused to find language or to consider your response to the question.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here are my corrections for the sentences in yesterday's lesson.</p>
<p>1. "There are many reasons to believe why" is a clumsy phrase. Instead, write:</p>
<p>- There are many <em><strong>reasons why</strong></em> this is detrimental.<br>- There are many <strong><em>reasons why I believe that</em></strong> this is detrimental.<br>- I believe that this is detrimental for several reasons.</p>
<p>2. They have an impact on young <em><strong>adult<span style="text-decoration: underline;">s'</span></strong></em> health. (plural possessive)</p>
<p>3. We need to use the <em><strong>uncountable</strong></em> (not plural) form of the word <em><strong>exercise</strong></em>. We're talking about 'exercise' in general, not a specific number of exercises.</p>
<p>- The number of people doing physical <em><strong>exercise</strong></em> is falling.</p>
<p>4. "By spending hours on television" is a problematic phrase because "on television" is usually used when we're talking about the people who <em><strong>appear on</strong></em> TV. For example, if you say "I was on television yesterday", it means that you appeared on a TV programme. To avoid confusion, we need to write:</p>
<p>- By spending hours <strong><em>watching</em></strong> television...<br>- We lead a sedentary life because we spend so many hours <em><strong>watching</strong></em> TV.</p>

	<p>
				<p>A common topic for the short presentation (IELTS Speaking Part 2) is "describe an important festival in your country".</p>
<p>My advice is to look for a description of your festival on Wikipedia. Copy the best parts of the description and make small changes if necessary. As an example, I've copied a short description of Christmas from Wikipedia.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Describe a festival: Christmas</strong></span></p>
<p>Christmas is an annual holiday that, in Christianity, commemorates the birth of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Popular customs of the holiday include gift-giving, music, an exchange of greeting cards, church celebrations, a special meal, and the display of various decorations; including Christmas trees, lights, nativity scenes, and holly. In addition, Father Christmas (known as Santa Claus in some areas) is a popular figure in many countries, associated with the bringing of gifts for children.</p>
<p>Over the Christmas period, people decorate their homes and exchange gifts. In some countries, children perform plays re-telling the events of the Nativity, or sing carols that reference the event. Christmas, along with Easter, is the period of highest annual church attendance.</p>
<p>A special Christmas family meal is an important part of the celebration for many, and what is served varies greatly from country to country. In England and countries influenced by its traditions, a standard Christmas meal includes turkey, potatoes, vegetables, sausages and gravy, followed by Christmas pudding, mince pies and fruit cake.</p>

				<p>Your priority in part 1 of the speaking test should be to demonstrate <em><strong>fluency</strong></em>, not difficult grammar or vocabulary. You'll speak more fluently if you keep your part 1 answers simple.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of how I would simplify students' answers.<br>Note: the students' answers contain some mistakes.</p>
<p><strong>Student's answer:</strong><br>Logically people from different generation will have taste variation. Depending upon the maturity, music stars of their own age, impact of globalisation as well as technological development in music industry will divide younger and older generation.</p>
<p><strong>My simplified answer:</strong><br>Of course, people from different generations have different tastes in music. Popular music changes all the time, and most of us are influenced by whatever style of music is popular when we are growing up.</p>
<p><strong>Student's answer:</strong><br>Yes, I am fond of music. It is simply the medicine for my mind. When I am stressed, music remove stress. When I am happy, music inspires me to be more. It always in the centre of all my parties with friends. When I am sad, music takes me out glue and move forward.</p>
<p><strong>My simplified answer:</strong><br>Yes, I love music, mainly because it helps to put me in a better mood. When I'm stressed or sad, music picks me up and puts me in a positive frame of mind.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here are my sample answers to the questions in last Friday's lesson. Can you find any useful vocabulary in my responses?</p>
<p><em><strong>What are the most difficult jobs that people do?</strong></em></p>
<p>I think jobs can be hard for various different reasons. Some professions, such as concert pianist or surgeon, are difficult in the sense that they require a high level of skill that must be developed through many years of study and practice. On the other hand, jobs like police officer, firefighter or soldier might not require such high skill levels, but they are known to be extremely stressful and sometimes traumatic.</p>
<p><em><strong>Why do you think some people choose to do difficult jobs?</strong></em></p>
<p>I suppose we all want to do something meaningful. For some people, this means achieving a great ambition that takes years of hard work. People who choose dangerous jobs might do so for altruistic reasons or because they feel it's their duty to contribute to society.</p>
<p><em><strong>Do you agree or disagree that all jobs are difficult sometimes?</strong></em></p>
<p>I would have to disagree with that. I think we all feel that our jobs are difficult or stressful at times, but in the grand scheme of things we have nothing to complain about. A tight deadline or a lost computer file are really just minor inconveniences when compared with the horrors of war that soldiers face, or the life-and-death situations that paramedics see every day.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Yesterday we looked at two simple methods that can help you to generate ideas for IELTS topics.</p>
<p>Here's a third tip: Think about personal examples or stories.</p>
<p>So, do you have a personal example or story about how the arts have affected your life? I'm sure you remember a special experience, such as seeing a famous painting, attending a wonderful concert, or reading a great work of fiction. Practise telling your story!</p>

	<p>
				<p>On my <a href="https://ieltssimon.substack.com">member site</a> I asked students to prepare vocabulary ideas for the following topic:</p>
<p><em><strong>What do the arts contribute to our lives?</strong></em></p>
<p>I gave two tips that can help you to think of vocabulary ideas.</p>
<p><strong>1) Start by thinking of examples to make the topic (the arts) more real.</strong></p>
<p>- Paintings e.g. in the National Gallery in London<br>- Music e.g. live concerts and performances<br>- Theatre e.g. a Shakespeare play</p>
<p><strong>2) Then think about the topic from different perspectives.</strong></p>
<p>- <strong>Personal:</strong> enjoyment, inspiration, enrich our lives, capture our imagination<br>- <strong>Cultural:</strong> heritage, national identity, connection to the past<br>- <strong>Economic:</strong> employment, boost the economy, attract visitors, tourism</p>
<p>Some of the students shared many more ideas, and they seemed to find the 'perspectives' idea useful. Try it yourself.</p>

	<p>
				<p>How would you answer these questions (from Cambridge 14, test 3)?</p>

<li>What are the most difficult jobs that people do?</li>
<li>Why do you think some people choose to do difficult jobs?</li>

	<p>
				<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>Do not use</strong></em></span> the following phrases instead of "Firstly" when you are organising ideas in an essay:</p>
<ul>
<li>At first</li>
<li>Initially</li>
<li>In the beginning</li>
<li>At the beginning</li>
<li>In the first place</li>
</ul>
<p>These phrases do exist in English, but they are not the same as "Firstly".</p>
<p>In the same way, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>do not use</strong></em></span> these phrases instead of "Finally":</p>
<ul>
<li>At last</li>
<li>At the end</li>
<li>In the end</li>
<li>In the last place</li>

<p>You don't need to learn different ways to say "Firstly" or "Finally". The examiner is not looking for 'difficult' organisational phrases. Spend your time learning <em><strong>topic vocabulary</strong></em> instead.</p>

	<p>
				<p><em><strong>Describe a book that you enjoyed reading because you had to think a lot.</strong></em><br><em><strong>You should say:</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>- what this book was</strong></em><br><em><strong>- why you decided to read it</strong></em><br><em><strong>- what reading this book made you think about</strong></em><br><em><strong>- and explain why you enjoyed reading this book.</strong></em></p>
<p>Here's my band 9 answer, using vocabulary from last week's <a href="https://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2019/11/ielts-speaking-part-2-less-common-vocabulary.html">lesson</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m going to talk about a book that really made me think, and that has had a positive effect on my life. The name of the book is ‘Atomic Habits’, and it’s about the compounding effect that small decisions and minuscule changes can have on people’s lives.</li>
<li>I decided to read Atomic Habits after seeing an interview with the book’s author, James Clear, who is a world-renowned expert in the field of habit formation. In the interview, he told inspiring stories and revealed some simple life hacks that can make people more productive, motivated and happy. I found the whole idea of the ‘science of tiny habits’ fascinating, and so I bought the book straight away.</li>
<li>While reading the book, I was forced to confront my own habits and behaviours. I realised that I’m nowhere near as productive as I could be, but that some small tweaks to my routine could make a significant and long-lasting difference. The book also gave me a framework to understand how good habits are formed and how bad habits can be broken. It has encouraged me to analyse my own habits accordingly.</li>
<li>I thoroughly enjoyed reading Atomic Habits because I thought it was well researched, well reasoned and well written. The author’s ideas and advice aren’t simply his opinions; they are taken from cutting-edge research and real success stories. I enjoy reading books that change my way of thinking in some way or give me practical, life-altering ideas, and this was definitely one of those books.</li>

<p>As I write this blog post, I'm not thinking about grammar, and I don't have any pre-prepared words or phrases that I'm hoping to use. My only aim is to communicate a message, and my only task, in terms of language, is to choose the right words in order to deliver my message clearly.</p>
<p>Try this yourself when you're speaking or writing in English. Push all of your worries out of your mind e.g. grammar, impressing the examiner, your score, what you've studied etc.</p>
<p>Instead, just focus on two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>The message that you want to communicate.</li>
<li>Choosing your words carefully to deliver that message.</li>

	<p>
				<p>In last Friday's <a href="https://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2019/10/ielts-speaking-part-2-describe-a-book.html">lesson</a> I shared a task that asks you to describe a book. To prepare for this description, let's choose a book and 'steal' some ideas from an online summary / review.</p>
<p>I'm currently reading a book called <a href="https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits">'Atomic Habits'</a>. I found a summary and a review of this book on Amazon (see below), so I'll steal some ideas and use them in my answer next Friday. Maybe you could prepare ideas, in the same way, for a book that you've read.</p>
<p><strong>Here's a quick summary from Amazon:</strong></p>
<p>People think when you want to change your life, you need to think big. But world-renowned habits expert James Clear has discovered another way. He knows that real change comes from the compound effect of hundreds of small decisions – doing two push-ups a day, waking up five minutes early, or holding a single short phone call. He calls them atomic habits.<br><br>In this ground-breaking book, Clear reveals exactly how these minuscule changes can grow into such life-altering outcomes. He uncovers a handful of simple life hacks, and delves into cutting-edge psychology and neuroscience to explain why they matter. Along the way, he tells inspiring stories of Olympic gold medalists, leading CEOs, and distinguished scientists who have used the science of tiny habits to stay productive, motivated, and happy.</p>
<p><strong>And here's a customer review (there are many others on Amazon):</strong></p>
<p>I feel lucky to have found this book. It's the only self-help book that I've thought, afterwards, was worth reading. It's had a dramatic positive impact on my life. It's well researched, well reasoned, and well written. A self-help book that actually makes a significant, and long-lasting difference. I'm going to keep re-reading it.</p>

	<p>
				<p>A student asked me to <em><strong>explain</strong></em> the difference between the words below:</p>
<ul>
<li>trait</li>
<li>personality</li>
<li>character</li>
<li>characteristic</li>
</ul>
<p>But when we <em><strong>explain</strong></em> vocabulary, we're not getting the full picture. An explanation might help you to <em><strong>understand</strong></em> a meaning, but it won't necessarily help you to <strong><em>use</em></strong> the vocabulary in a natural way.</p>
<p>Instead of explaining, which is a 'grammar mindset' exercise, let's shift to a 'vocabulary mindset' and look at usage.</p>
<p>Fill the gaps below using the word that seems most natural.</p>
<ol>
<li>My client is a person of good ______.</li>
<li>My worst ______ is that I am sometimes self-centred.</li>
<li>A key ______ of entrepreneurs is that they are action-oriented.</li>
<li>She's a little girl with a big ______.</li>

	<p>
				<p>In last week's grammar lesson on my <a href="https://ieltssimon.substack.com">member site</a> I highlighted some key mistakes in a student's task 1 answer. The most important mistake involved the student's use of the word 'while'.</p>
<p>The student wrote something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Spending on salaries rose<strong>. While,</strong> spending on resources fell.<br></em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Note: the student used 'while' incorrectly between two simple sentences)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The correct version would be this:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Spending on salaries rose<strong>, while</strong> spending on resources fell.<br></em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Note: the correct version is a complex sentence)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The student made three similar mistakes with the word 'while', and I gave the answer a band 6 for grammar. If the student had written three correct 'while' sentences, I would have given a 7 for grammar.</p>
<p>I call this type of mistake a <strong><em>'sticking point'</em></strong> because it keeps you stuck on a lower band. In this case, the 'while' mistake is important because the student missed the opportunity to create three complex sentences.</p>
<p>Ask a teacher to help you to look for 'sticking points' in your writing. Getting past these sticking points could be the fastest route to a higher score.</p>

				<p>I sometimes receive questions from students about the '<a href="https://www.examenglish.com/vocabulary/academic_wordlist.html">academic word list</a>'. Here's what people want to know:</p>
<p><em><strong>Is this list useful for IELTS preparation?</strong></em></p>
<p>The short answer (in my opinion) is <strong>no</strong>. I've never used the academic word list with IELTS students.</p>
<p>Here's a longer answer:</p>
<p>Of course there are lots of useful words on the academic word list, and it would be great if you knew all of them. But remember: <em><strong>understanding is not the same as using</strong></em>. You would need to spend time learning how to <em><strong>use</strong></em> the words correctly in phrases and sentences. Furthermore, the list contains only individual words; you need to build your knowledge of phrases and collocations, and the list doesn't help you with that.</p>
<p>If you're preparing for IELTS, I think you have other priorities: test practice, exam techniques, question types, topic vocabulary, phrases and collocations, reducing grammar mistakes etc. Unless you have <em><strong>a lot</strong></em> of study time, I wouldn't include the academic word list in your study schedule.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here's my answer to the task in yesterday's lesson: the method was fine, but the language can be improved.</p>
<p><strong>The method is fine:</strong><br>The student wrote the introduction in the way that I recommend: the first sentence introduces the topic, and the second sentence answers the question.</p>
<p><strong>But there are some language problems (underlined below):</strong><br>There are different views <span style="text-decoration: underline;">regarding on question that</span> should children be punished to learn the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">discrepancy</span> between <span style="text-decoration: underline;">wrong and right</span>. From my perspective, some sorts of punishment<span style="text-decoration: underline;">s</span> as well as rewards are necessary to teach children, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">however</span>, parents and teachers should apply soft and simple forms of punishment.</p>
<p><strong>Here's my improved version:</strong><br>People have different views <span style="text-decoration: underline;">with regard to the question of whether</span> children should be punished in order to teach them the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">difference</span> between <span style="text-decoration: underline;">right and wrong</span>. In my opinion, simple or 'soft' punishments are a necessary tool for parents and teachers as they raise and educate children.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em><br>Sometimes people make 'mistakes' in their choice of vocabulary. For example, in English we say "the difference between right and wrong", not "the discrepancy between wrong and right". This is not a grammar mistake, it's a collocation mistake.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here are two sample answers that include opinions about the future:</p>
<p><em><strong>Will large shopping malls continue to be popular, despite the growth of internet shopping?</strong></em></p>
<p>I can’t see shopping malls disappearing any time soon, so yes, I think they will definitely continue to attract shoppers. We already have internet shopping, with websites like Amazon now mainstream, but the large shopping centres in my city are still packed with people. The Trafford Centre near Manchester, for example, is hugely popular, and I think this is because it offers more than just shopping. It’s a place where families go for a day out, to have lunch or to visit attractions like Sea Life or Legoland, and naturally they will browse the shops and buy things there too.</p>
<p><em><strong>Do you think that some businesses (e.g. banks and travel agents) will only operate online in future?</strong></em></p>
<p>I’m sure they will, and I think this is already happening. I’m pretty sure that there are online-only savings accounts, and there are travel websites like Airbnb that have no physical presence on the high street. I imagine that more and more services will only be available online; this seems to be the way that things are going.</p>

<p><em><strong>1. Do you think films <span style="text-decoration: underline;">have changed</span> since you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">were</span> a child?</strong></em></p>
<p>No, I don’t think films <span style="text-decoration: underline;">have changed</span> much since I <span style="text-decoration: underline;">was</span> a child.

I believe that candidates should focus on giving a good description in part 2, instead of worrying about verb tenses.</p>
<p>If the examiner wants to test your use of verb tenses, he/she can do this in <em><strong>part 3</strong></em> of the test, by choosing certain questions.</p>
<p><strong>Here are some typical 'tense' questions from speaking part 3:</strong></p>
<p>- Do you think _____ is different <strong><em>now</em></strong>, compared to when you <em><strong>were</strong></em> a child?<br>- <em><strong>Did</strong></em> your teachers _____ when you were at school?<br>- How do you think _____ <em><strong>will change</strong></em> in the future?</p>

<p><em><strong>1) What type of photos do you like taking?</strong></em></p>
<p>Well, I don't usually take photos to be honest. I prefer to enjoy whatever I'm doing, rather than stop to take a photograph.</p>
<p><em><strong>2) What do you do with photos you take?</strong></em></p>
<p>I don't really do anything with the occasional photos that I take. They just stay on my phone and I forget to save them or upload them to my computer.</p>
<p><em><strong>3) When you visit other places, do you take photos or buy postcards?</strong></em></p>
<p>Neither. As I said, I prefer to enjoy myself, so I tend to let other people take photos. I used to buy and send postcards when I was younger, so maybe I should go back to doing that.</p>
<p><em><strong>4) Do you like people taking photos of you?</strong></em></p>
<p>As a child I was always a bit shy when it came to having my photo taken, so I would have said that I didn't like it. These days, if someone wants to take a photo of me, I don't mind at all.</p>

	<p>
				<p>In <a href="https://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2019/08/ielts-speaking-part-2-past-present-future.html">this lesson</a> I asked for your views on a technique that some students and teachers are using: they use three verb tenses (past, present, future - PPF) to organise their speaking part 2 answers. In other words, they begin by answering in the past tense, then they move to the present and into the future.</p>
<p>Here's my view on this:</p>
<p>I'm not a fan of this PPF technique because it encourages you to go into the speaking test with a 'grammar mindset'. Your brain is focusing on verb tenses instead of more important things: the task, the bullet points, your ideas, and the vocabulary that you're going to use to express those ideas.</p>
<p>If there's one thing that I stand against as an English / IELTS teacher, it's the 'grammar mindset' and the idea that you can impress the examiner with 'complex structures'.</p>
<p>I'm a <a href="https://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2018/10/ielts-advice-the-vocabulary-mindset.html">'vocabulary mindset'</a> teacher. I want my students to focus on the 'true content' of their answers, rather than grammar tricks.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here are some sample answers for the 'nice home' questions that I asked you to look at two weeks ago. The questions come from Cambridge IELTS 14.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> I try to answer in a natural and slightly informal way, but with some good 'topic vocabulary'.</p>
<p><em><strong>Why do some people buy lots of things for their home?</strong></em></p>
<p>I think there could be a couple of different reasons for this. Some people like to surround themselves with beautiful objects and furnishings to brighten up their lives, while others buy lots of devices that are supposed to save time. In my own home we have examples of both types of object: we have things like ornaments and pictures because they look nice, and we have useful gadgets, like a small vacuum cleaner that we recently bought.</p>
<p><em><strong>Do you think it is very expensive to make a home look nice?</strong></em></p>
<p>No, definitely not. Basic furniture isn’t expensive these days, especially now that we have shops like Ikea. I know plenty of people who have furnished and decorated their homes really nicely without spending too much money. Personally I also like the minimalist look: some basic furniture, light colours and not too much clutter.</p>
<p><em><strong>Why don't some people care about how their home looks?</strong></em></p>
<p>Maybe they just see their homes as a base - somewhere to eat and sleep - rather than a reflection of their tastes or personalities. And many people are just too busy with work and life outside the home to worry about furniture and decorations. A friend of mine, for example, doesn’t seem to care about the way his house looks, but this is because he’s almost never there; he travels for work and spends more time in hotel rooms than in his own house.</p>

If you attend a course of English lessons, for example, it shouldn't be an easy course. You need to feel like you're learning something useful in every lesson, and your teacher should be highlighting your mistakes and pushing you to perform better.</span></li>

By following this blog, you are already doing this to some extent.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">Finally, use the Internet to get as much language 'input' as you can. Even if you're studying alone, you have access to a world of English content online. You can probably also find people to talk to and practise with.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">Here's a shorter answer: Surround yourself with as much English as you can, and take every opportunity to practise what you learn.</span></p>

<p>Before I give you my opinion about this technique, I'd like to hear from you.</p>

				<p>What's the fastest way to improve your English?</p>
<p>Well, in my opinion the answer is this: <em><strong>put yourself in the best possible English language environment.</strong></em></p>
<p>Studying alone is a slow, hard journey. But if you can find a way to surround yourself with English speakers, or a community of English learners, you'll make faster progress and the journey won't seem so arduous.</p>
<p>If you're feeling stuck or isolated as you learn English and prepare for the IELTS test, perhaps you need to find an environment or community that can carry you forward.</p>

				<p>Many students ask how long it will take to get from an intermediate level (maybe IELTS band 5) to an advanced level (band 7).</p>
<p>If you were learning to play the piano, would you expect to go from intermediate to advanced in a few weeks? Would you expect to find a special technique that suddenly makes you an advanced pianist? The answer is no. Most people know that they would need to work hard and practise every day to get to an advanced level on the piano.</p>
<p>In my opinion, learning a new language is a similar challenge. You should aim to make small, gradual improvements because it isn't realistic to expect sudden changes.</p>

	<h4><a href="https://www.ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2019/08/ielts-advice-plethora.html">IELTS Advice: 'plethora'</a></h4>
	<p>
				<p>Yesterday I told you that my examiner friend and I advise students not to use the word 'plethora' in their essays. Why not? Well, for a plethora ;) of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plethora means 'many'. If you write that there are a plethora of reasons and then give only one or two reasons, you've used the word wrongly.</li>
<li>The word plethora seems too exaggerated, pompous or pretentious for an IELTS essay. It doesn't suit the 'measured' academic style that we're aiming for.</li>
<li>If the rest of your essay is written in a more basic style, a word like plethora will stand out as strange and unnatural.</li>
<li>If you attempt to use 'impressive' words but your essay is full of mistakes, it is obvious to the examiner that you're trying to show off. When surrounded by grammar mistakes, a word like plethora looks even more unnatural.</li>
<li>I'm a native speaker, and I would only use the word plethora if I really wanted to exaggerate something, or to sound pretentious on purpose (perhaps for humorous effect). I wouldn't use it in an academic essay.</li>
<li>Finally, plethora is an example of what I call an <em><strong>'any essay</strong> <strong>word'</strong></em>. Students learn words like this because they hope to use them in any essay, regardless of the topic. In other words, these students are trying to 'trick' the examiner into being impressed - this doesn't work. If you want to impress the examiner, you should focus on specific <a href="https://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2019/05/ielts-vocabulary-topic-specific-vocabulary.html">topic vocabulary</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope this convinces you to stop learning words like plethora. Just write "there are several reasons" or "there are two main reasons" and then focus on describing them. Leave the pompous language to politicians!</p>

	<p>
				<p>The following answers are at 'band 9' level. Which words and phrases help my answers to get such a high score?</p>
<p><em><strong>1. What do you think makes a good lesson?</strong></em></p>
<p>I think a good lesson is one that is interesting and engaging. By 'engaging' I mean that the students should feel involved in the lesson; they should feel that they are learning something new that is relevant to them. In my opinion, a lot depends on how the teacher delivers the content of the lesson in a way that students like. My favourite teacher at university used to involve the students by making us teach some of the lessons ourselves.</p>
<p><em><strong>2. Do you think it's better to have a teacher or to teach yourself?</strong></em></p>
<p>Well, there's no substitute for a good teacher. I think you can teach yourself, but you can learn a lot more quickly with the guidance of a teacher. For example, when learning a language, you really need someone to correct your mistakes; you can get the grammar and vocabulary from books, but books can't tell you where you're going wrong.</p>
<p><em><strong>3. Do you think the traditional classroom will disappear in the future?</strong></em></p>
<p>I don't think it will disappear, but it might become less common. I think more people will study independently, using different technologies rather than sitting in a classroom. Maybe students will attend a lesson just once a week, and spend the rest of their time following online courses or watching video lessons.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Many students write to me because they are worried about strange or difficult questions they have found (usually for writing task 2).</p>
<p>I think you need to remember that it's impossible to prepare for every topic or question that might appear in the exam. You will go mad if you try to do this!</p>
<p>The solution is to make sure you "know what you know". Focus on the <a href="https://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2016/05/ielts-vocabulary-topic-list.html">common topics</a> that appear regularly, not the strange topic that your friend found on a website.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Too many students (and teachers) waste time worrying about the 'complex structures' aspect of the grammar score in the writing test.</p>
<p>From what I've seen when marking essays, 99% of students are able to write sentences with more than one clause, using words like <strong><em>and, but, because, while, which, if...</em></strong> to connect ideas. Therefore, they are able to meet the requirement for 'complex structures'.</p>
<p>On the other hand, many of the same students are <strong><em>not</em></strong> able to produce <em><strong>frequent error-free sentences</strong></em> (band 7), and it's rare for me to see essays in which <strong><em>the majority of sentences are error-free</em></strong> (band 8).</p>
<p>So, if people can't produce error-free sentences, why are they worrying about complex structures? In most cases, the key to a high grammar score is <strong><em>fewer mistakes</em></strong>, not more complex sentences.</p>

				<p>Sometimes the part 2 task looks difficult but there's an easy way to answer. Here are three examples:</p>
<p><em><strong>1) Describe something that you collect.</strong></em></p>
<p>Most students panic because they don't collect anything. But this question is easier than you think. If your hobby is listening to music or reading books, just tell the examiner that you collect CDs or novels. You could talk about your "collection" of clothes or shoes. Everyone has a collection of something, even if you don't call yourself a collector.</p>
<p><em><strong>2) Describe an important decision that you made.</strong></em></p>
<p>Easy. Just talk about the subject you chose to study or the career you decided to pursue. If you moved to live/study in a different country, you could talk about that.</p>
<p><em><strong>3) Describe an important letter you received.</strong></em></p>
<p>Use the answer you gave for number 2 (with a few small changes). Talk about the letter you received confirming your place on a university course, or confirming a successful job application.</p>

<p><em><strong>2. How useful will English be for your future?</strong></em></p>
<p>English is essential in my field of work; most of the research that is being done in this area is published in English, so I read articles and papers in English every day.</p>
<p><em><strong>3. How much travelling do you hope to do in the future?</strong></em></p>
<p>I’d like to see more of the world, so it would be nice to be able to travel extensively at some point, maybe when I’m retired.</p>
<p><em><strong>4. How do you think your life will change in the future?</strong></em></p>

<p>The first restaurant that we came across looked perfect. It had plenty of empty tables - we hadn’t booked in advance - and we were all happy with the menu. But as soon as we walked through the door, things started to go wrong, and we weren’t at all impressed with the attitude of the staff.</p>
<p>After standing around for a few minutes waiting for someone to greet us, I managed to attract the attention of a waitress who told me that we had come into the restaurant through the wrong door. So, I went over to the main door, only to be told by the manager that there were no tables free for a party of our size - there were eight of us. I could see several free tables with four seats, so I suggested simply moving two of these tables together. But the manager was adamant that this was impossible; our only option was to divide the family and sit at two separate tables.</p>
<p>By this time, some of my family members were getting fed up. The restaurant was half empty, yet we were being treated as if they didn’t need customers. We decided we didn’t want to sit at separate tables or stay in a place where we felt unwelcome. We left, feeling disappointed by how dismissive the restaurant manager had been, and fortunately we found a much friendlier place to eat just around the corner.</p>

				<p>Look at the two short paragraphs below. Can you see the difference between them?</p>
<p><strong>Paragraph 1</strong><br>Every member of society should contribute to improving the environment. We all need to take responsibility for the environmental issues that face the planet. If each individual person plays his or her part, our world will remain habitable for future generations.</p>
<p><strong>Paragraph 2</strong><br>Every member of society should contribute to improving the environment. Small daily actions, like turning lights off or recycling paper, glass and plastics, can make a difference. I also try to play my part by walking or by taking public transport rather than driving.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis</strong></p>
<p>Paragraph 1 might look good in terms of the vocabulary that I used, but it doesn't really move forward. The three sentences basically say the same thing in different ways. It's all too general.</p>
<p>Paragraph 2 might seem simpler, but it's much better in terms of 'task response' and 'coherence' because the main idea is extended and we can see some progression. Can you see the <em><strong>movement from general to specific</strong></em> in this paragraph?</p>

	<p>
				<p>I've been checking students' essays this week, and one of the most noticeable problems has been this: <em><strong>most essays are too general</strong></em>, and so there's not enough development and progression of ideas.</p>
<p>When writing a paragraph, or when giving a longer answer in part 3 of the speaking test, try to use a <em><strong>general to specific</strong></em> approach. Start with a general idea, then explain it in more detail.</p>
<p>Note: Don't just explain the same general idea in a different way. Your answer needs to <em><strong>move forward</strong></em>.</p>

	<p>
				<p>One of the main aims of this blog is to give people a method for tackling each aspect of the IELTS test.</p>
<p>I hear from many people who have been successful after following my advice, but I also hear from people who haven't passed yet. And when people are stuck on the same score, they sometimes think that "the method isn't working". But this is the wrong way to think.</p>
<p>Methods / exam techniques will only help you to get the score that reflects your current level of English. If your English level is 'beginner' or 'intermediate', no method will suddenly give you a band 7. Exam techniques don't increase your vocabulary knowledge or your grammatical accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>Remember that we're working on 2 things here:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Methods e.g. knowing how to write an essay.</li>
<li>English language e.g. expressing your ideas using good vocabulary and without making mistakes.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you've been following my advice but you're stuck on the same score, don't change your method! Instead, work on point 2 above.</p>

	<p>
				<p>While you may be marked down by the examiner if you <strong><em>hesitate</em></strong> too often, there's nothing wrong with speaking a bit more <em><strong>slowly and carefully</strong></em>.</p>
<p>In my experience, many students speak too quickly and this causes several problems. If you speak too quickly, you're more likely to make grammar and pronunciation mistakes, and you'll probably lose clarity and coherence. If you slow down, you'll have more time to think, to pronounce words clearly, and to correct yourself if necessary.</p>
<p>One more tip: Have you ever practised pronouncing words <em><strong>very very</strong></em> slowly? For example, can you pronounce every individual vowel and consonant sound in the word "slowly" (s...l...ow...l...y)? I've tried this with students and they are not usually very good at it - they find it easier to rush the pronunciation of words. Native speaker children, on the other hand, love pronouncing slowly and do it very well, so maybe it's something that adult language learners should practise more!</p>

If you still don't understand the second time, try to say something related to the topic or any of the words that you heard. Try your best, then focus on the next question.</p>
<p><strong>Part 2</strong><br>You are given a task card with the question written on it, so you shouldn't have any problems in this part. If there is a word that you don't understand on the task card, don't ask the examiner - he/she is not allowed to help.</p>
<p><strong>Part 3</strong><br>In this part of the test, the examiner is allowed to rephrase the question. If you don't understand, just say something like: "Sorry, can you explain that question in a different way please?"</p>

	<p>
				<p>Yesterday I said that linking words don't help your vocabulary score, and that you need to use 'topic specific' vocabulary if you want a high score.</p>
<p>But what is 'topic specific' vocabulary?</p>
<p>The answer is: vocabulary that you would <em><strong>probably only use for one particular essay topic</strong></em>. For example, I used this vocabulary in a lesson last week:</p>
<p>- no visual element<br>- brings us closer to reality<br>- presented in limited depth<br>- excellent communication tools<br>- an even greater impact on the viewer</p>
<p>You might be able to adapt these phrases to a different topic, but it wouldn't be easy; they are quite specific to the particular question in <a href="https://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2019/04/ielts-writing-task-2-a-rare-5-paragraph-essay.html">this lesson</a>.

<p>If you've followed my lessons on this blog, you'll know that "any essay" phrases are not the secret to getting a high score in IELTS writing.

<p>Here are some ideas that you could use in your description:</p>
<ul>
<li>a free academic search engine</li>
<li>it searches scholarly sources, such as academic publishers</li>
<li>easy to use - the same interface as normal Google</li>
<li>it finds article titles and provides bibliographic information</li>
<li>e.g. author, journal, year of publication</li>
<li>it finds both restricted and publicly available articles</li>
<li>it provides links to related articles</li>
<li>you can search by year of publication</li>
<li>bookmark articles to read later</li>
</ul>
<p>If you've used Google Scholar as a student (or teacher), try using the above ideas to create your description. Don't forget to add your own examples, experiences or stories to make the description more personal.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Today I want to share some advice from another IELTS teacher that I found in the 'comments' area below <a href="https://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2019/05/ielts-advice-linking.html">this lesson</a>.</p>
<p><strong>First, here's the question from a student called Vishaal:</strong></p>
<p>Please guide me on how I can reduce the grammatical errors in my speech. Although I reduced these errors significantly in writing, I'm still making quite a few mistakes during the speaking.</p>
<p><strong>And here's the advice from the teacher, sjm (thanks again!):</strong></p>
<p>The only real way is to sit with a native speaker, and ask them to stop you every time you make a grammar error, and give you a correction. You then repeat the correct version back to them.</p>
<p>It is time consuming, but eventually your error rate should drop. The problem with speaking is that errors are often 'fossilised' in the mouth, which means that you are so used to saying them that your mouth has 'memorised' them. You need to almost 'reprogram' your mouth.</p>
<p><strong>An extra tip from me (Simon):</strong></p>
<p>Vishaal's issue is very common, and I completely agree with sjm's advice. But if you don't have a private teacher or native speaker who can help in the way that sjm suggests, your best solution is probably to become <em><strong>better at copying</strong></em>. Instead of trying to translate ideas from your own language, or trying to construct sentences using your knowledge of English grammar, aim to build your sentences using phrases or 'chunks' of language that you know to be correct (because you have seen or heard them being used by native speakers).</p>

	<h4><a href="https://www.ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2019/05/ielts-advice-linking.html">IELTS Advice: linking</a></h4>
	<p>
				<p>Many IELTS students become obsessed with 'linkers' - words or phrases that link ideas together in a paragraph e.g. firstly, secondly, furthermore, moreover. There is nothing wrong with using linkers, and they can certainly help you to write good paragraphs.</p>
<p>However, linkers become a problem when they are the only thing that students care about. Examiners care much more about the <em><strong>content between</strong></em> the linkers.</p>
<p>As an experiment, try writing a paragraph without linking words. Can you still make your paragraph coherent? Note: you probably don't use many linkers when you write in your own language!</p>

	<p>
				<p>Many students believe that they need to use <em><strong>difficult grammar</strong></em> in order to get a band 7 or higher. But, in fact, the secret to a high grammar score is being able to write <em><strong>error-free</strong></em> sentences.</p>
<p>Look at the band descriptors for writing task 2 and you'll see this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Band 7: frequent error-free sentences</li>
<li>Band 8: the majority of sentences are error-free</li>
</ul>
<p>So, there's no point trying to impress the examiner with difficult structures if none of your sentences are error-free. It's better to keep things simple and avoid mistakes.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Remember that Part 1 questions are supposed to be easy. Just give a simple answer and a reason.</p>
<p><strong><em>1. What form of transport do you prefer to use? Why?</em></strong></p>
<p>I prefer to travel by car because it means that I have my own space. Also, the buses and trains in my city are usually overcrowded; my car is much more comfortable.</p>
<p><strong><em>2. How much time do you spend travelling on a normal day?</em></strong></p>
<p>I probably spend about an hour and a half travelling to and from work. I travel during the rush hours, so there is quite a lot of traffic.</p>
<p><strong><em>3. What do you do while you are travelling?</em></strong></p>
<p>I usually listen to the radio or a CD. In the morning I like to listen to the news to find out what is happening in the world.</p>
<p><strong><em>4. Do you ever have problems with transport?</em></strong></p>
<p>Yes, as I said, I get stuck in traffic on my way to and from work. I used to get annoyed by traffic jams, but now I'm used to them.</p>
<p><strong>A few important points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In the answer to question 4, can you see the difference between "I used to" and "I'm used to"?</li>
<li>Notice the good vocabulary: 'have my own space', 'overcrowded', 'to and from work', 'rush hour', 'find out what is happening in the world', 'get stuck in traffic'.</li>
<li>If the examiner asks a question that you have already answered, just say "as I said" and repeat your answer.</li>

				<p>Regarding the advice that I gave yesterday (stop and smile), I just want to clarify that there are no marks for body language in the speaking test. The "stop and smile" idea is simply a way to show the examiner that you're ready for the next question in part 1 of the test.</p>
<p>So, smiling won't help your score, but it can help with the "flow" of questions and answers in part 1.</p>

	<p>
				<p>In part 1 of the speaking test you need to give short, direct answers. When you've given your answer, you should stop and wait for the next question.</p>
<p>The problem is that many candidates keep speaking, even when they have already given a good answer. Sometimes it's because they feel nervous about leaving a moment of silence. As they keep speaking, they start hesitating and repeating themselves, making the answer sound worse and worse. A further problem is that the examiner has to interrupt the candidate in order to move on to the next question.</p>
<p>The solution that I practise with my students is this: <strong>stop and smile!</strong> When you've answered the question, stop confidently and smile at the examiner to show that you're ready for the next question. If you can do this, part 1 of the speaking test will go more smoothly.</p>

	<p>
				<p>What are the best things to do in the last week before your exam? Here are some tips:</p>
<p><strong>1. Nothing new</strong><br>It's often best not to study anything new just before an exam. "Revision" means studying what you have already studied to make sure that you know it well. The aim is to be confident about what you <em><strong>do</strong></em> know, rather than worrying about what you <em><strong>don't</strong></em> know.</p>
<p><strong>2. Common topics</strong><br>It's always a good idea to look again at the most common topics for IELTS writing and speaking. Make sure you have some ideas, opinions and vocabulary for topics like 'education', 'environment' etc.</p>
<p><strong>3. Test practice</strong><br>If you have never done a full test (e.g. a full one-hour reading test) before, you might get a shock in the real exam! Timing is a big problem, so practise a full test in strict exam conditions. Don't worry about your score; just focus on finishing everything within the time limit.</p>

	<p>
				<p>At the end of yesterday's lesson I mentioned that you could prepare some examples or stories to make your descriptions more interesting (for speaking part 2, and maybe part 3).</p>
<p>When speaking in our own languages, we tell stories all the time. For example, you might tell a member of your family about what happened at work today, or you might tell your friends about a film you saw last night.</p>
<p>The ability to tell a story in English is a sign that you are becoming a proficient user of the language. Test yourself: try telling a story in English now. Start with something easy, like "what I did yesterday".</p>

	<p>
				<p>It's impossible to prepare for <em><strong>every</strong></em> question that you might get in the speaking test, but what are the <em><strong>essential</strong></em> things to prepare for?</p>
<p>Here's my list of essentials:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Favourites</span>: Don't go into the test without knowing what your favourites are. Prepare to talk about your favourite book, film, music, and website.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">People</span>: Be ready to talk about a famous person and a member of your family.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Activities</span>: Have you prepared some ideas about a hobby? Can you describe a typical day in your life?</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Events:</span> Try to remember some special moments in your life, such as birthdays, festivals and weddings.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Places</span>: You need to be able to talk about where you live. Also, think about the places you have visited, what you did there, and why you liked or didn't like them.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Things</span>: Can you talk about the things you use every day, something you would like to buy, or a present that you received?</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember that in part 2 you are always asked to <strong>"describe"</strong>. Make sure you prepare some good adjectives for each topic, make sure you can talk about your opinions and feelings, and think about some examples or stories to make your descriptions more interesting.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Many people work hard but with the wrong aims. Their hard work takes them in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>Here are two examples of the <strong>wrong aims</strong> (for IELTS students):</p>
<ol>
<li>Learning "impressive" phrases for linking and organising your ideas.</li>
<li>Becoming better at English grammar by working through exercises in a grammar book.</li>
</ol>
<p>You could do many hours of hard work on these two aims, but I doubt that your IELTS scores would improve.</p>
<p>Your next question should be: What are the <strong>right aims</strong>? If you've read enough of my lessons, you'll know what I think. Maybe you would like to share your aims in the comments below this lesson, and we can discuss and refine them.</p>

	<p>
				<p>I noticed a comment from someone who didn't like the phrase "I'm going to talk about" (at the beginning of a part 2 description). He/she described "I'm going to talk about" as an old-fashioned template phrase.</p>
<p>Is this true? Is it an old-fashioned template phrase? <strong>The answer is no!</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>I'm going to talk about</strong></em> is neither old-fashioned nor part of a template. It is simply a natural way to begin your description. As a native English speaker, I would use this phrase without thinking twice about it.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> In the speaking and writing tests, it's best to use short, simple phrases for linking and organising your ideas. Stop worrying about these phrases, and focus on what comes <em><strong>after</strong></em> them: your answer and the 'topic vocabulary' that you use to express your ideas.</p>

	<p>
				<p>People who become good at things do the basics well, and they only show off occasionally.</p>
<p>For example, native speakers (of any language) spend most of their time using clear and relatively simple language. They might add a 'flourish' here and there, but it's rare to meet a native speaker who tries to make every sentence seem impressive.</p>
<p>I try to persuade students to aim for this 'natural' native-speaker style of writing and speaking. Learn to write and speak in a clear, simple, accurate and coherent way. Leave the rhetorical flourishes to politicians and professional writers!</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here are my 3-step (answer, explain, example) answers to the questions that I showed you last Friday:</p>
<p><strong>1. How much has technology improved how we communicate with each other?</strong></p>
<p>I'd say that technology has made communication faster and easier, but I don't think it has improved the quality of communication between people. I mean, it's so easy to send a text message or write a comment on social media these days, but maybe you could say that our conversations are quite superficial compared to the way people communicated in the past. For example, I remember writing long, detailed letters to friends and family members when I was younger, but I tend to just send quick messages from my phone nowadays.</p>
<p><strong>2. Do you agree that there are still many more major technological innovations to be made?</strong></p>
<p>Of course! People are working on all sorts of new technologies as we speak, and I'm sure that there will be technological advances and breakthroughs for as long as human societies exist. Personally, I'm fascinated to see what happens with self-driving cars and other types of artificial intelligence over the next few decades.</p>
<p><strong>3. Could you suggest some reasons why some people are deciding to reduce their use of technology?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I think the main reasons are that people feel overwhelmed or that their use of technology is becoming unhealthy. Some people have realised that all the devices and applications that they use are making their lives more complicated and stressful than necessary. Others might see themselves becoming addicted to checking their phones, or wasting too much time on their social media pages. I try to limit my own use of my phone and laptop because I want to spend more of my time in the 'real world' than on the Internet.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Every IELTS teacher will suggest a slightly different way of doing each part of the test. In other words, teachers have different methods.</p>
<p>An example of a method is my <a href="https://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2015/02/ielts-writing-task-2-13-sentences.html">13-sentences</a> approach to writing a task 2 essay. This is how I like to break down the writing task, but it isn't the only way. Other teachers' methods can be equally good.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are principles that all IELTS teachers should agree on. For example, when you write an essay, you need to present a clear position and answer all parts of the question.</p>
<p>Many IELTS students are confused by all of the different 'methods' that teachers give them. Perhaps we need to focus more on 'principles'.</p>

	<p>
				<p>I've written about the difference between <em><strong>understanding</strong></em> and <em><strong>using</strong></em> before, but I think it's worth repeating this idea.</p>
<p>Have another look at the list of phrases in yesterday's lesson. Perhaps you <em><strong>understand</strong></em> all of the individual words in that list. But ask yourself this: would you have been able to <em><strong>use</strong></em> those words to create correct phrases, and a coherent essay, in the same way that I did?</p>
<p>Using words and phrases is much more difficult than simply understanding what they mean. While <em><strong>understanding</strong></em> only requires a quick dictionary search, <em><strong>using</strong></em> requires considerable language experience and practice.</p>

The deeper you study something, the more you'll learn from it. So go deeper, study hard, and you're sure to improve!</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here are some part 1 questions from Cambridge IELTS book 8, with my sample answers. How would you answer these questions?</p>
<p><em><strong>1. How well do you know the people who live next door to you?</strong></em></p>
<p>I know my neighbours quite well. They're really nice people, and I always stop to talk whenever I see them.</p>
<p><em><strong>2. How often do you see them?</strong></em></p>
<p>I see my neighbours at least a few times a week. We usually see each other when we're leaving for work in the morning or coming home in the evening.</p>
<p><em><strong>3. What kinds of problem do people sometimes have with their neighbours?</strong></em></p>
<p>I think the most common problem is probably noise. It's difficult to live next to people who have a dog that barks at night, or who play loud music.</p>
<p><em><strong>4. How do you think neighbours can help each other?</strong></em></p>
<p>Neighbours can do little things like watching your house if you go on holiday or taking a delivery if something arrives by post when you're not at home. I think these little favours are a good way for neighbours to help each other.</p>

	<p>
				<p>A few people have asked me about these phrases. Do they have the same meaning? When is each one used?</p>
<p><strong>By contrast / In contrast</strong><br>I often use these two phrases in both writing task 1 and 2. They are exactly the same, and are used in a similar way to "however" or "on the other hand" to introduce a contrast / comparison. Put "By / In contrast" at the beginning of a sentence, with a comma after "contrast".</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong><br>Unemployment rose in the UK. By contrast, the number of unemployed people in Canada fell.</p>
<p><strong>On the contrary</strong><br>I don't think you'll need this phrase for any part of the IELTS test.&nbsp;It doesn't mean the same thing as "by / in contrast". We use "on the contrary" to deny that something is true, and to explain that the opposite is true.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong><br>- Person 1: "You had some problems with your hotel, didn't you?"<br>- Person 2: "On the contrary, the hotel was great, but the airline lost my suitcase."</p>

	<p>
				<p>By the time they reach part 3 of the speaking test, many IELTS candidates just want to finish and go home.

	<p>
				<p>The list of <em><strong>less common vocabulary</strong></em> in yesterday's lesson didn't contain any words that are 'big' or impressive on their own.</p>
<p>In fact, if you're trying to impress the examiner with good vocabulary, you shouldn't be worrying about <em><strong>individual</strong></em> words at all. Instead, you should be trying to show that you can use <em><strong>interesting groups of words</strong></em>.</p>
<p>Here's an easy example. The three words below are not particularly special or impressive on their own:</p>
<p>- incredible<br>- beautiful<br>- images</p>
<p>But look at how I put these words together in the sentence below:</p>
<p><em><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; -moz-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">The TV trailers were really eye-catching because they showed <strong>incredibly beautiful images</strong> of nature.</span></em></p>
<p>The phrase "incredibly beautiful images" is much more interesting (and 'less common') than the three individual words that it contains.</p>
<p><strong>Remember:</strong> It's only when you start putting words together that the language comes alive. Focus on groups of words, not individual 'big' words.</p>

				<p>Did you note down the following 'less common' phrases from the description that I wrote yesterday? Could you use these phrases in your own sentences?</p>
<ul>
<li>each episode featured</li>
<li>spectacular footage</li>
<li>it was broadcast</li>

<li>it was advertised repeatedly</li>
<li>it was aired (means 'it was shown on TV')</li>

<li>stunning photography</li>
<li>global scope</li>

</ul>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em><br>The phrase 'less common vocabulary' (or 'uncommon lexical items') is used in the examiner's mark scheme. It refers to any vocabulary that examiners don't expect most candidates to use. But this <em><strong>doesn't</strong></em> mean 'difficult' words; it means the kind of 'natural' phrases that native speakers use. A good example is "DVD box set" - this isn't a difficult phrase, but it's something that English <span style="text-decoration: underline;">learners</span> might not be expected to use.</p>

	<p>
				<p><em><strong>Describe an educational television programme that you liked.</strong></em><br><em><strong>You should say</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>- what the programme was about</strong></em><br><em><strong>- when and where you saw it</strong></em><br><em><strong>- how you found out about this programme</strong></em><br><em><strong>- and why you liked it.</strong></em></p>
<p>Here's my band 9 answer. Can you see any 'less common' vocabulary?</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m going to talk about one of my favourite educational TV programmes, which is a nature documentary called ‘Planet Earth’. There were eleven episodes of this programme, and each one featured a different habitat on Earth, such as mountains, caves, deserts and jungles. The aim of the ‘Planet Earth’ series was to take the viewer into those habitats, using spectacular footage of interesting animals, plants and landscapes.</li>
<li>I first saw ‘Planet Earth’ on television when it was broadcast by the BBC several years ago. I think it was shown every Sunday evening, which was the perfect time to watch a fascinating nature programme. Then, a few years a ago, somebody bought me the DVD box set of the whole series as a Christmas present, and I watched the episodes again.</li>
<li>I found out about this TV programme because it was advertised repeatedly in the weeks before it was first aired. The TV trailers were really eye-catching because they showed incredibly beautiful images of nature. I also recognised the voice of the narrator of the programme, the well-known naturalist David Attenborough. It was these trailers that persuaded me to watch the first episode.</li>
<li>What I liked most about the ‘Planet Earth’ series was its stunning photography and its global scope. For example, in the “Fresh Water” episode, they showed us the giant salamander in Japan, crocodiles in the river Nile, and river dolphins in the Amazon. I was amazed at how they had managed to film such interesting creatures in so many locations. I enjoyed learning about strange animal species, and the programme opened my eyes to the hidden wonders of our planet.</li>

	<p>
				<p>IELTS isn't simply a test of how much 'difficult' vocabulary and grammar you can use. It also tests your ability to do 'easy' things with the language, like making a simple sentence that contains no mistakes.</p>
<p>Speaking part 1 is a good example of this. In this part of the speaking test, you will impress the examiner by answering without hesitation, by speaking in a natural and fluid way, and by using error-free simple sentences. You can show off your best language later in the test, but you should start, in part 1, by showing the examiner that you can do the 'easy' things well.</p>
<p>Note: many people don't do the easy things well.</p>

	<p>
				<p>A colleague asked me for some advice about how to help a student who is so worried about the IELTS writing test that she feels unable to write an essay. She says she has a mental block and just can't start writing.</p>
<p>In my opinion, this student's problem is that she is aiming too high too soon. She wants to write the perfect essay now, but she is afraid that she won't. She's putting too much pressure on herself to be successful.</p>
<p>So here's some advice for people who feel stuck or afraid: aim much lower! Imagine you're a lazy student who just wants to do his/her homework as quickly as possible, and write an essay that you know isn't your best work - write it quickly and carelessly. Write another 'bad' essay the next day and the day after that. Soon the fear of essay writing will have disappeared, and you'll start wanting to improve your 'bad' essays. When the fear of failure has gone, you'll be free to enjoy the challenge and to do your best work.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> if you are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> suffering from this essay writing 'fear', please ignore the advice above. Aim high, enjoy the challenge, and do your best work now!</p>

	<p>
				<p>Many students answer questions in IELTS speaking part 3 by saying "it depends".</p>
<p>"It depends" is <em><strong>not</strong></em> a full answer. You need to say <span style="text-decoration: underline;">what</span> it depends on, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">why</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Example question:</strong><br>Do you think it's important to find a job that you love, or is it more important to earn a good salary?</p>
<p><strong>Don't say:</strong><br>"It depends. Some people prefer to find a job they love, but other people want to earn a good salary." (This answer just repeats the question)</p>
<p><strong>Do say:</strong><br>"Personally, I'd prefer to do a job that I really enjoy; as long as I earn enough to live comfortably, the salary is less important. However, I can see the benefits of doing a job that you don't like if it pays well. With a good salary, you can probably do more enjoyable things in your free time."</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here are some techniques that should help you to paraphrase (to say the same thing in different ways):</p>
<p><strong>1) Use a synonym</strong></p>
<p>This is important = This is significant / crucial / vital</p>
<p><strong>2) Use an opposite</strong></p>
<p>I found it difficult = It wasn't easy for me</p>
<p><strong>3) Change active to passive</strong></p>
<p>You should not do this = This should not be done</p>
<p><strong>4) Use a related word (e.g. change the verb into a noun)</strong></p>
<p>The number rose = There was a rise in the number</p>
<p><strong>5) Consider a more formal or informal version</strong></p>
<p>I am worried = I am extremely concerned (formal) / I'm stressed out (informal)</p>

<p>You should definitely <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> do this!</p>

	<p>
				<p>Having ideas and opinions is important for IELTS Speaking Part 3. Even if your grammar is excellent, you will not get a high score if you don't know what to say.</p>
<p><em><strong>For example, do you have an opinion about whether governments should protect old buildings?</strong></em></p>

<ul>
<li>Historic buildings are part of a country’s heritage.</li>
<li>Old buildings are often considered to be works of art.</li>
<li>They give character to cities, and attract tourists.</li>
<li>We identify countries by architectural symbols, like the pyramids in Egypt.</li>
<li>Governments should spend money on looking after historic buildings.</li>

				<p>Yesterday I wrote that your English teacher should take you just outside your comfort zone. Your teacher should also be your best source of language and the 'model' that you try to copy.</p>
<p>Don't be afraid to copy the way I write or the way your favourite English speaker speaks. Copying is the best way to learn a language; it's much more reliable than translating word by word using a dictionary.</p>

				<p>In the comments below Wednesday's <a href="https://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2019/01/ielts-writing-task-2-paragraph-analysis.html">lesson</a>, one student wrote that he/she isn't able to write at the same level as me. This is a good thing!</p>
<p><em><strong>If you can already write at the same level as me, you don't need my help!</strong></em></p>
<p>The best way to learn is to have a teacher who takes you just outside your comfort zone. If the work is too easy you won't progress, and if it's far too difficult you won't be able to do it. A good teacher should give you work that is difficult, but achievable with help. Hopefully the paragraph that I wrote on Wednesday fits that description.</p>

	<p>
				<p><em>Describe an interesting house or apartment that you have visited.</em><br><em>You should say</em></p>
<p><em>- where the house or apartment was</em><br><em>- who lived there</em><br><em>- what it looked like on the outside and/or inside</em><br><em>- and explain why you found this house or apartment interesting.</em></p>
<p>Here's my sample band 9 answer, using ideas from last week's <a href="https://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2019/01/ielts-speaking-part-2-interesting-house.html">lesson</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m going to describe an apartment that I recently visited in the city centre of Manchester. The apartment was on the 10th floor of a brand new block that has just been built. This building is on the edge of the main commercial area of the city, and the apartment overlooks several of Manchester’s busiest shopping streets.</li>
<li>Nobody was living in the apartment when I went there, because it had only just been put on the market. I went to see it with a friend who is thinking of moving to Manchester; he wanted to view some different properties, and I decided to go along and see what the newest apartments were like.</li>
<li>From the outside, the apartment was in a tall, shiny glass building - nothing too remarkable. On the inside, as far as I remember, there weren’t many different colours: the walls were an off-white colour, the floors were done in whitish tiles, and the kitchen appliances were all silver metal coloured. I think the kitchen surfaces were made from dark grey granite. The main feature, in terms of the look of the apartment, was the huge floor-to-ceiling window in the living room, which allowed the sunlight to flood in.</li>
<li>Although the white and silver decor wasn’t really to my taste, I did like the fact that the apartment seemed so cool, clean and spacious. I particularly liked the open-plan kitchen and living room, which had all sorts of gadgets that could be operated by a mobile phone app. For example, I learnt how to use the app to control the lighting, heating, blinds, security cameras and even the cooker. I found it fascinating that the apartment contained so much up-to-the-minute technology, and that everything seemed to be connected via wifi. It felt like I was taking a glimpse into the future.</li>
</ul>

	<p>
				<p>Here's my quick brainstorm on the theme of the word 'easy'. I've divided it into a few different categories; you might find it helpful to do this yourself when brainstorming ideas.</p>
<p>Synonyms of 'easy'</p>
<ul>
<li>simple, straightforward, uncomplicated, effortless</li>
</ul>
<p>Informal phrases</p>
<ul>
<li>a piece of cake, a walk in the park, a breeze, a doddle</li>
</ul>
<p>Phrases with opposites</p>
<ul>
<li>it wasn't difficult, it wasn't hard, it didn't take much effort, it wasn't very challenging, it didn't present any real problems, I didn't really struggle</li>
</ul>
<p>Use an example to create context e.g. 'the exam was easy'</p>
<ul>
<li>it was fairly simple, I found it quite straightforward, I breezed through it, I could have done it in my sleep, it was easier than I expected</li>

	<p>
				<p>In yesterday’s lesson I brainstormed the theme of a modern apartment. It’s easy to brainstorm ideas when you focus on a specific word, and I was able to produce a useful list of ideas related to the word ‘modern’.</p>
<p>You can use this technique as a way to prepare for topics and to expand your overall vocabulary knowledge. Just choose a word (your ‘theme’) and brainstorm ideas related to it. You could also use the Internet as a source of ideas.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Task: </strong>Let’s&nbsp;take the word ‘<strong>easy</strong>’ as our theme. Can you list between five and ten words or phrases related to this theme?</p>

	<p>
				<p>Let's return to the part 2 task below.</p>
<p><em><strong>Describe an interesting house or apartment that you have visited.</strong></em><br><em><strong>You should say</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>- where the house or apartment was</strong></em><br><em><strong>- who lived there</strong></em><br><em><strong>- what it looked like on the outside and/or inside</strong></em><br><em><strong>- and explain why you found this house or apartment interesting.</strong></em></p>
<p>If I were working on this topic with students in a lesson, we would begin by preparing some good vocabulary ideas. I would ask my students to develop some vocabulary 'themes'.</p>
<p>For example, if we imagine that we are describing an apartment, perhaps a key theme could be that it is modern. Now we can develop the 'modern' theme:</p>
<ul>
<li>up to the minute</li>
<li>contemporary</li>
<li>fashionable, cool, trendy</li>
<li>decor, lighting, furniture</li>
<li>open-plan</li>
<li>colours and their effects e.g. relaxing, soothing</li>
<li>materials e.g. glass, metal, granite</li>
<li>rooms e.g. kitchen, living room</li>
<li>gadgets, appliances</li>
<li>windows, heating</li>
<li>remote control, digital, phone app</li>
<li>overall feeling e.g. sharp, clean, efficient, spacious</li>
</ul>
<p>Try using some of these ideas to describe the inside of a modern apartment and to explain why you like it.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Yesterday I suggested that you'll need to work on both exam technique and English language as you prepare for the IELTS test. So how can IELTS-Simon help you with these two things?</p>
<p><strong>Exam technique</strong><br>The fastest way to learn how to approach the IELTS test is to watch the video lessons that I published on <a href="http://subscriptions.viddler.com/SimonCorcoran">this website</a>. The videos take you step by step through each part of the test, and you'll see me giving band 9 answers using clear and simple exam techniques. I consider the video lessons to be my best work, and I don't know of any other course that provides such a methodical and effective approach.</p>
<p>Of course, this blog contains the same advice that you'll find in the video lessons. The difference is that the blog isn't written as a step-by-step course. If you have the time, go back through the blog's <a href="https://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/archives.html">archives</a> or <a href="https://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2016/07/ielts-advice-search-this-website.html">search</a> the blog for anything that you need. I think I've probably written a lesson about almost any IELTS problem that you might have.</p>
<p><strong>English language</strong><br>The ultimate aim of this blog is to help you to improve your English. You'll find many lessons in which language, rather than exam technique, is the main focus.</p>
<p>I'm also trying to cover as many IELTS topics as possible here on the blog, and you'll find plenty of vocabulary ideas (words, phrases, examples, opinions etc.) that you can 'copy' from me and use in your own answers.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Let's think about what you're going to do in 2019. Broadly speaking, you'll probably need to work on two main things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Exam technique</li>
<li>English language</li>
</ol>
<p>Both of these areas are important, but if we're talking about a whole year of study, I think it's far more important to <em><strong>improve your English</strong></em>.</p>
<p>Imagine yourself at the end of 2019. Surely your priority should be to have a better overall level of English, not just to collect more exam tips and techniques.</p>

	<p>
				<p style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">Do the 3 parts of the speaking test carry equal weighting when your score is calculated, or is one part more important?</p>
<p style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">The simple answer is that the 3 parts are not scored separately; the examiner rates the candidate's performance as a whole. In this sense, neither part is more important.</p>
<p style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">However, it's useful to think about the 3 parts like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Part 1 is supposed to be quite easy (like a warm-up), so you won't get a high score if you<em><strong> only </strong></em>do well in this part.</li>
<li>Part 2 is when the examiner really gets a chance to assess how good you are. He/she will now have an idea of what scores to give you.</li>
<li>During part 3, the examiner is making his/her final decision. A good performance here can boost your score.</li>

	<p>
				<p>Language learners often think they <em>know</em> something (e.g. a word, phrase, grammar rule) because they understand it or because they have studied it before. However, there is a huge difference between understanding something and really knowing it.</p>
<p><em>'Really knowing'</em> means being able to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">use</span> the word, phrase or grammar rule.</p>

<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em><br>Don't ask the examiner: "Do you mean in my country or here in England?" - it doesn't matter. Don't worry if you have a job and study at the same time - you can mention both.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong><br>Describe an interesting house or apartment.</p>
<p><strong>First three sentences of the answer:</strong><br><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important;">Well, living in an apartment is an overgrowing trend not only in my country but all over the world. We have our own apartment which is really awesome. By the way, I would like to talk about a new apartment/flat that I have recently visited.</span></p>
<p>The real answer begins in the third sentence with the words <em><strong>"I would like to talk about"</strong></em>. This is where I would begin. Everything before that is just background waffle*. Examiners don't like this waffle; you'll impress them more if you get straight to the point and answer directly.</p>
<p>waffle = lengthy but vague or trivial talk or writing (i.e. useless extra words that you don't need)</p>

I think the celebration is important because it marks the end of a period of effort, and so it's a chance to enjoy the moment, to take stock of what you have achieved, and to share the achievement with others. This is why, for example, universities have graduation ceremonies, which encourage students to celebrate together and to take pride in what they have done.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; -moz-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">2) I'll answer using a "firstly, secondly, finally" structure:</span></strong></p>

One reason could be that some people don't like to show off or draw attention to themselves. Other people perhaps don't value their own accomplishments because they are constantly aiming at even bigger goals. Finally, I suppose that many of us are so busy that we don't stop to savour the moment; maybe we need to slow down and enjoy our successes.</span></p>

</ul>
<p><em><strong>They</strong></em> and <em><strong>their</strong></em> are used instead of <strong><em>he or she</em></strong> and <em><strong>his or her</strong></em>.</p>
<p>This is very common in English, and it is unlikely that someone would say: "Somebody left <em><strong>his or her</strong></em> umbrella. Would <em><strong>he or she</strong></em> please collect it?"</p>
<p>But can we use "they" with a singular in the IELTS test?</p>
<p>The simple answer is yes, but my own preference is a little more complicated. When speaking, I naturally use "they" with singular nouns from time to time. But I tend to avoid doing this in written essays, as I prefer to stick to the normal grammatical conventions. For example, I used "he or she" in the sentence below, which comes from <a href="Firstly, it is hard for a person to be happy if he or she does not have a safe place to live and enough food to eat.">this essay</a>.</p>
<p><em><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; -moz-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">Firstly, it is hard for a person to be happy if <strong>he or she</strong> does not have a safe place to live and enough food to eat.</span></em></p>

				<p>In part 3 of the speaking test you should try to give longer, detailed answers. A good way to do this is to imagine that you are making a paragraph.</p>
<p>Remember the 'paragraph building' techniques that we use in writing task 2:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Idea, explain, example</span><br>Start with a direct answer to the question, like the 'topic sentence' in a written paragraph. Then explain your answer in more detail, and support your explanation with an example.</p>

				<p>If you take lessons with an English teacher, I recommend that you ask yourself this question at the end of each lesson:</p>
<p><em>Did I learn some <strong>new language</strong> in this lesson, or did I become <strong>better at using</strong> some language that I already knew?</em></p>
<p>In other words, you are asking yourself whether you worked on your vocabulary <em><strong>range</strong></em> (new words and phrases) or on your <em><strong>flexibility</strong></em> (becoming better at using the language that you already knew).</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here are two tips regarding pronunciation.</p>
<p><strong>1) Improving your pronunciation score in the speaking test</strong></p>
<p>This is an exercise that you could do maybe once a week: Try recording yourself as you answer some IELTS speaking questions, then listen to the recording and analyse just one feature of pronunciation. For example, you could focus on intonation: Did your voice sound flat and boring, or did you manage to show interest and enthusiasm? If possible, ask a native speaker to give the same answers, and listen to the rising and falling of his or her voice. Try to copy that intonation.</p>
<p>You could do a similar thing for other aspects of pronunciation e.g. individual sounds, word stress, connected speech and sentence stress.</p>
<p><strong>2) The importance of pronunciation in language learning</strong></p>
<p>In my opinion, pronunciation is perhaps the most overlooked 'secret' to learning a new language. As a serious language student, you'll learn to recognise and produce sounds that don't exist in your own language. You'll try to copy the connected speech, word stress, sentence stress and intonation patterns that native speakers use.</p>
<p>And as you become better at doing these things, the language starts to open up and welcome you in. Your listening skills improve, you find it easier to chat to native speakers, and your repertoire of phrases grows effortlessly. The best language learners (children) all know this secret!</p>

	<p>
				<p>Unfortunately, many candidates give <em><strong>shallow</strong></em> answers in their IELTS speaking and writing tests. They mention a few different ideas, but fail to develop any of them in detail. They would get higher scores if they just took one idea and developed it in detail; this is what I call a <strong><em>deep</em></strong> answer.</p>
<p>Practise explaining just one idea in as much detail as you can. The ability to do this could really benefit your speaking and writing scores.</p>

	<p>
				<p>One thing I noticed as an examiner is that many students forget to use simple words like "and" or "but". At the same time, they overuse words like "moreover" and "furthermore".</p>
<p>Native speakers use "and" all the time (in both speech and writing). You can use "and" or "but" as many times as you want; the examiner will not notice!</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you use "moreover" or "furthermore" more than once, the examiner will notice straight away. These words do not get you a high score. In fact, in the speaking exam, they make your English sound 'forced'.</p>

</ol>
<p>Answer: None of these are correct sentences. None of them has a main verb.</p>
<p>To make a sentence, you need a <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">subject</span> (noun/noun phrase) and a <span style="background-color: #80c0ff;">verb</span>:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">I </span><span style="background-color: #80c0ff;">am learning</span> a foreign language. OR, <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">Learning a foreign language</span> <span style="background-color: #80c0ff;">is</span> useful.</li>

	<p>
				<p>Here are my sample answers to the 'singing' questions that I shared last week. Remember: there's no need to show off in part 1. It's more important to demonstrate your fluency at this stage. Try to give short, simple answers without too much hesitation.</p>
<p><em><strong>1. Did you enjoy singing when you were younger?</strong></em></p>
<p>No, I was never much of a singer. I remember that I was always a little shy and embarrassed when it came to singing in front of others.</p>
<p><em><strong>2. How often do you sing now?</strong></em></p>
<p>I don't sing in public, but I do sometimes find myself singing along to songs if I'm listening to music in the car. Perhaps this happens once a week or less.</p>
<p><em><strong>3. Do you have a favourite song you like listening to?</strong></em></p>
<p>No, not at the moment. I used to have favourite songs when I was a teenager - when I was discovering new music - but these days I prefer to listen to a variety of music, rather than a particular favourite tune.</p>
<p><em><strong>4. How important is singing in your culture?</strong></em></p>
<p>It seems to be really important these days. TV programmes like 'X Factor', which are basically singing contests, are hugely popular at the moment. So many young people dream of being famous singers.</p>

	<p>
				<p>One of the things that I liked about the presentation in <a href="https://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2018/10/ielts-listening-presentation-about-better-communication.html">this lesson</a> was the idea that 'structures' are so important in any form of communication. When you are speaking or writing (in any context, not just for the IELTS test), the way you structure your ideas makes a difference. A good structure keeps your audience (the listener or reader) interested and on track; it will also add to the coherence, power and persuasiveness of your message.</p>
<p>Consider this example: a sales presentation using a "problem and solution" structure. The sales person explains a problem and then tells the audience how his/her product or service can solve this problem. This simple structure is used in countless advertising and marketing campaigns.</p>
<p>Now let's think about the structures that we use in the IELTS test. Can you list the structures that I've used in my speaking and writing lessons? Here's one example: "answer, explain, example" in part 3 of the speaking test.</p>

	<p>
				<p>For many of the students I've taught, a breakthrough (or big improvement) came when they found the confidence to write and speak in a more 'simple' way.</p>
<p>When you stop worrying about whether you need to use passives, conditionals or 'difficult academic words', you are free to focus on answering the question and explaining your ideas coherently. It takes confidence to change your approach and to believe that the 'simple' way will work.</p>
<p><em>Note: </em>Remember that 'simple' is not the same thing as 'easy'!</p>

				<p>In my opinion, a good language learner is someone who <em><strong>collects</strong></em> words and phrases. But the best learners don't simply store their collections and allow them to get dusty; they <strong><em>use</em></strong> them.</p>
<p>How about you? Are you a language collector? Did you collect any good phrases from the essay that I shared on Wednesday? Did you note them down? Do you regularly review your collection and try to use it?</p>

	<p>
				<p>Yesterday I advised you to <em><strong>start slowly</strong></em> when studying something new. Today I'd like to share a short conversation that I had with a student. I think this is a good example of a problem that many students face: they don't take the time to do things slowly and properly!</p>
<p><strong>The student's question:</strong><br>Hi Simon. Brainstorming ideas when I'm writing essays didn't work for me. My essays look better when I'm writing without planning and brainstorming. Should I continue brainstorming until I'm good at it or write without planning. What do you advise?</p>
<p><strong>My answer:</strong><br>My advice is this: whenever you try a new technique, start very slowly. So, try following my planning advice again, but give yourself as much time as you need. It doesn't matter if it takes you an hour to create a good essay plan at first - just aim to get the plan right. Then see what happens when you write an essay using a really good plan. Again, don't give yourself a time limit. When you're comfortable planning and writing in this way, gradually speed up! Perhaps your problem was that you were going too fast.</p>
<p><strong>The student's response:</strong><br>Definitely, yes you are right I'm going too fast and I always place importance on the speed of my writing. The reason I am in a hurry is I think there are lots of topics I need to work on.</p>

				<p>Imagine a musician (pianist, guitarist etc.) who is learning a new technique, or a new piece of music or song. Musicians learn by going slowly at first and gradually speeding up as they become familiar with the technique or music.</p>
<p>I recommend the same when you start preparing for IELTS, or when you learn a new exam technique or study a new topic: start slowly. Try to achieve the score you need at <strong><em>slow speed</em></strong>, and then gradually reduce the time until you can do the same at <strong><em>exam speed</em></strong>.</p>

	<p>
				<p>I've written about this before, but I think it's a message that I need to keep repeating:</p>
<p>Too many candidates approach the IELTS exam with a <em><strong>grammar mindset</strong></em>. They go into the test with their heads full of 'grammatical structures' that they think will impress the examiner. Unfortunately this approach is more likely to hinder you than help you.</p>
<p>I'm trying to persuade people to have a <em><strong>vocabulary mindset</strong></em>. This means that you go into the test knowing that you have prepared ideas for common IELTS topics, and with the aim of expressing your ideas coherently and in as much detail as you can.</p>
<p>Here's a quick question to see which mindset you have:</p>
<p><em><strong>Which of the two activities below do you spend more time doing?</strong></em></p>
<ol>
<li>practising complex sentences, passives and conditionals; learning lists of linking words and phrases; worrying that you make too many mistakes</li>
<li>collecting ideas for IELTS topics and past exam questions; reading and listening to English (not just IELTS related); trying to copy the way native speakers write and speak</li>

	<p>
				<p><em><strong>Describe a photograph of you that you like. You should say</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>- where the photo was taken</strong></em><br><em><strong>- what you were doing when it was taken</strong></em><br><em><strong>- who took it</strong></em><br><em><strong>- and explain why you like the photo.</strong></em></p>
<p>Here's my full answer using the vocabulary ideas from <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2018/09/ielts-speaking-part-2-describe-a-photo.html">this lesson</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The photograph that immediately comes to mind when I think of one that I like is my university graduation photo. It was taken just before the graduation ceremony that marked the end of my undergraduate degree. You can’t see anything in the background of the photo, but it was actually taken in the students’ cafe next to the hall where the ceremony was held.</li>
<li>In the photo, I’m wearing the traditional clothing for university graduates: a black gown and an academic cap, which is often called a mortar board. I’m also holding my rolled-up degree certificate. Obviously this was a formal portrait photo, and so I was standing still, smiling and looking into the camera.</li>
<li>The person who took the photo was a professional photographer. He had been hired by the university to set up in the cafe and take photos of graduates before the ceremony. He had a white screen, some lighting devices, and an assistant who took payments and collected our details.</li>
<li>The reason why I like my graduation photo is that it reminds me of a pivotal moment in my life. Being presented with my degree certificate at the graduation ceremony was the culmination of four years of hard work, and it marked the end of the ‘education’ stage of my life. I had achieved my objectives and made my family proud, and I knew that the next step was to look for my first proper job. Whenever I look at the photo it brings back happy memories, both of my university days and of the relief and contentment that I felt on my graduation day.</li>

	<p>
				<p>There is usually a <strong>gap</strong> between the IELTS scores that people get when they practise at home and the scores they get when they take a real test.</p>
<p>For example, maybe you can achieve a band 7 when you write essays without a time limit, but you get a band 6 when you take the test. This is a gap of one band.</p>
<p>Here are some tips relating to this 'performance gap':</p>
<ol>
<li>There should be a gap!</li>
<li>If there isn't a gap, something is wrong with the way you're studying.</li>
<li>If the gap is too big, you're doing something wrong in the exam.</li>
<li>First, try to make the gap bigger through study and learning.</li>
<li>Then try to make the gap smaller by practising in exam conditions.</li>
</ol>
<p>I hope this makes sense! Let me know if you've noticed this gap. How big is it, and what are you doing to make it bigger or smaller?</p>

I don't think you can trust an amateur when it's a once-in-a-lifetime event.</span></p>

<p><em>When you "brainstorm" ideas for an IELTS essay, what is the number one rule?</em></p>
<p>Only one person gave an answer that was close to what I was looking for. Here's my answer to this question:</p>
<p>The key idea behind "brainstorming" is that you write down <em><strong>anything that comes into your head</strong></em>: good ideas, bad ideas, irrelevant ideas... just write them all down. You can organise them and cross out the bad ones later.</p>
<p>People who forget this 'rule' often get stuck because they are afraid that their ideas aren't good enough. Don't judge yourself at the brainstorming stage.</p>

	<p>
				<p>As I said in last Friday's lesson, the task below isn't really about a photograph. It's about whatever is <strong><em>in</em></strong> the photograph (e.g. an event).</p>
<p><strong><em>Describe a photograph of you that you like. You should say</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>- where the photo was taken</em></strong><br><strong><em>- what you were doing when it was taken</em></strong><br><strong><em>- who took it</em></strong><br><strong><em>- and explain why you like the photo.</em></strong></p>
<p>Let's imagine that we are going to describe a <em><strong>graduation photo</strong></em> - a photograph of you on the day of your university graduation ceremony.</p>
<p>See if you can include the following phrases in your description:</p>
<ul>
<li>graduation ceremony</li>
<li>professional photographer</li>
<li>traditional academic dress / outfit</li>
<li>wore a gown / robe and cap / hood</li>
<li>holding my certificate</li>
<li>made myself and my family proud</li>
<li>the culmination of several years of hard work</li>
<li>achieved my dream</li>
<li>a landmark, a key moment, a pivotal moment</li>
<li>marks the end of a stage in my life</li>
<li>reminds me of my university days</li>
<li>brings back happy memories</li>
<li>remember feeling elated, overjoyed</li>
</ul>

	<p>
				<p>Try this useful technique for IELTS writing and speaking:</p>
<p><strong>Give an opinion, then follow it with a conditional sentence.</strong></p>
<p>Look at these examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>In my opinion, governments should invest more money in public transport. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">If</span> rail and bus services <span style="text-decoration: underline;">were</span> more reliable, fewer people <span style="text-decoration: underline;">would need</span> to drive.</li>
<li>Schools have an important role to play in children's health. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">If</span> schools <span style="text-decoration: underline;">banned</span> junk food, they <span style="text-decoration: underline;">would help</span> to reduce the problem of childhood obesity.</li>
<li>In the future I think more people will do their shopping online. But <span style="text-decoration: underline;">if</span> Internet shopping <span style="text-decoration: underline;">becomes</span> more popular, many traditional shops <span style="text-decoration: underline;">will lose</span> customers.</li>
</ol>
<p>I've underlined the conditionals. Examples 1 and 2 are second conditionals, while 3 uses the first conditional.</p>
<p><em><strong>Practice:</strong></em><br>Prepare your own "opinion + conditional" ideas for different topics. Having a few of these ideas ready could help you in the writing and speaking tests.</p>

<p>Now think about this:<br>What is the <strong><em>real</em></strong> topic of this task? Is it photography or photographs?</p>
<p>The answer is no. I think you'll probably talk about <em><strong>a holiday, a special event, </strong></em>or perhaps<em><strong> an activity </strong></em>or<em><strong> a hobby</strong></em>. One of these topics will be your real topic.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Don't let the word "photograph" dominate your thinking. If you do that, you'll start to worry that you don't know enough "photography" vocabulary. Instead, focus on the holiday, event or activity.</p>

<p><strong>Part 1 questions</strong></p>
<p>1. What type of photos do you like taking?<br>2. What do you do with photos you take?<br>3. When you visit other places, do you take photos or buy postcards?<br>4. Do you like people taking photos of you?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: small;"><em><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; -moz-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">I often wonder why so many people look for vocabulary websites when they have one right under their noses: ielts-simon.com. If you went through all the lessons Simon has posted over the years and picked up all the great words and phrases along the way, I'm sure you'd be well on your way to getting band 7+ in IELTS.</span></em></span></p>

	<p>
				<p>Last week (see lessons from Friday to Sunday) I gave you an overview of how examiners score IELTS speaking tests. I also said that I would explain the idea of 'less common' and 'idiomatic' vocabulary in more detail.</p>
<p>First some simple definitions:</p>
<ul>
<li>'Idiomatic' is defined in most dictionaries in this way: using, containing, or denoting expressions that are <em><strong>natural to a native speaker</strong></em>.</li>
<li>'Less common' must therefore mean 'less commonly used by <strong><em>learners</em></strong> of English', <strong><em>not</em></strong> 'less commonly used by native speakers'.</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, 'less common' and 'idiomatic' basically mean the same thing: phrases that native speakers naturally use, but English learners don't often use.</p>
<p>This is why I tell people that examiners are not looking for 'big' or 'difficult' words. They are looking for phrases and collocations.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Let's consider what an examiner might be thinking during part 3 of the speaking test.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Speaking Part 3</strong></span></p>
<p>After part 2 of the speaking test, the examiner probably has a pretty good idea of the candidate's level. Part 3 is useful because it allows the examiner to probe a little deeper to make sure that he/she is right. For example, if the examiner is unsure about what score to give for grammar, he/she might choose a question that requires the candidate to compare the past with the present (i.e. using different tenses), or a question that requires the candidate to imagine something (perhaps using a conditional).</p>
<p>When I was an examiner, I used part 3 as an opportunity to push candidates a little harder. I tried to get them to open up, express themselves, and explain their opinions. In other words, I was giving them a final chance to impress me with some good English. This is what you should try to do.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Don't let your energy or effort level drop after part 2. Do your best to leave a good impression on the examiner. <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2017/05/ielts-speaking-part-3-longer-answers.html">This technique</a> will help you.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> I'll come back to yesterday's point about '<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">less common' and 'idiomatic' vocabulary</span> in next Friday's lesson.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Continuing from yesterday's lesson, here's my quick guide to how examiners judge candidates' performance in part 2 of the speaking test.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Speaking Part 2</strong></span></p>
<p>Part 2 gives the examiner a chance to <em><strong>really</strong></em> listen to the candidate's English. When I was an examiner, I used to imagine that I had my eyes closed (of course I didn't actually close them) so that I could concentrate only on what I was hearing.</p>
<p>In this part of the test, the examiner can judge all aspects of performance. But above all, I believe that part 2 is the candidate's best chance to impress the examiner in one key area: <strong><em>vocabulary</em></strong> (lexical resource). In order to give a high score, the examiner needs to hear some 'less common' and 'idiomatic' vocabulary. In simple terms, this means that candidates need to use some phrases that a native speaker might use in a normal conversation.*</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Part 2 is your best chance to impress the examiner with good language. But I don't mean 'complex grammar' and lots of fancy linking words. Focus on giving an interesting and detailed description that contains a range of relevant words and phrases.</p>
<p>*I'll say more about 'less common' and 'idiomatic' vocabulary next Friday.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here's a rough guide to how examiners decide what scores to give in the speaking test. At least, this is how I used to approach scoring when I was an examiner.</p>
<p>I'll look at part 1 of the speaking test today, and then I'll cover parts 2 and 3 over the weekend.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Speaking Part 1</strong></span></p>
<p>Examiners are aware that part 1 questions are quite easy, and that candidates will only be able to give relatively short answers. Therefore, they are not expecting to hear any "super-impressive" language at this stage.</p>
<p>Instead, I believe that examiners are getting an <em><strong>overall impression</strong></em> of the candidate's ability in the following areas: pronunciation, avoiding mistakes in simple / easy sentences, answering without too much hesitation, speaking fluently without too much repetition.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Candidates perform better if they focus on answering fluently. Easy answers are fine; just make them as fluent and natural as possible.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Students often ask me to explain why their scores have dropped. For example, one student got a band 7 in speaking last month, but his speaking score dropped to 6 this month. How is that possible?</p>
<p>You might think that the examiner has been too strict or has done something wrong, but this is probably not the case. The best explanation for fluctuating IELTS scores is <em><strong>performance on the day</strong></em>.</p>
<p>Some days you perform well: the topics in the exam seem to suit you, your brain seems to find good answers and remember good words or phrases, and you finish all parts of the test in the time allowed. Other days nothing seems to go right; you simply have a bad day.</p>
<p>Don't worry if your score fluctuates; this is completely normal. One day everything will go perfectly, and you'll get the scores you need!</p>
<p>Note: Your scores will also fluctuate if you keep changing the 'method' that you use.</p>

<p>Here's my solution to this problem: stop using so many different books and websites! Choose one website, or one book, or one teacher, and follow one consistent method. If you read contradictory advice in a different book, ignore it - it's just a different method.</p>

				<p>Remember to keep your part 1 answers short and 'to the point'. Here are my example answers for some questions about walking:</p>
<p><em><strong>1. Do you like walking?</strong></em></p>
<p>I'm not one for going on really long walks in the countryside, but I don't mind walking when I'm in a town or city, for example when I'm sightseeing in a new place.</p>
<p><em><strong>2. Do you think walking is important?</strong></em></p>
<p>Yes, I think it's important to be active, and walking is the most basic physical activity that we can do.</p>
<p><em><strong>3. Do you think walking in the countryside is better than walking in the city?</strong></em></p>
<p>Personally, no. As I said before, I like walking in the city, especially if it's somewhere with a lot of history like London or Paris.</p>
<p><em><strong>4. What could be done to improve the experience of walking in cities?</strong></em></p>
<p>I suppose the main issues are space and safety. Pavements need to be wide enough to accommodate lots of pedestrians, and we need safe places to cross the street.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here are three tips, one for each part of the speaking test.</p>
<p><strong>Part 1: stop and smile</strong><br>For part 1 of the speaking test, you need to get used to giving short answers. Many students find it difficult to stop speaking, and the examiner is forced to interrupt. My tip is to give your answer then stop and smile, showing the examiner that you are ready for the next question.</p>
<p><strong>Part 2: tell a story</strong><br>In the context of speaking part 2, a story is simply a long example to illustrate a point that you have made. If you’re describing a person, for example, you could tell a story to illustrate why you like him/her. People find it easy to keep speaking for longer when they have a story to tell.</p>
<p><strong>Part 3: include an ‘if...’ sentence</strong><br>Look at technique number 2 in <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2013/03/ielts-speaking-part-3-longer-answers.html" target="_self" title="">this lesson</a>.

				<p>People often argue that "there's no best method" with regard to learning a language, or perhaps with regard to IELTS preparation.</p>
<p>While I agree with the "no best method" idea to a large extent, I believe that we should add to this statement:</p>
<p>"There's no <em><strong>best</strong></em> method, but you still need to choose <em><strong>a</strong></em> method."</p>
<p>And perhaps we could add a bit more:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't keep changing methods. Find one that works and stick to it.</li>
<li>Trust the method of an 'expert' e.g. your teacher or someone who has already been successful.</li>
<li>There may be several good methods, but bad methods also exist. Choose a good method and avoid the bad ones!</li>

	<p>
				<p>It's difficult to think about grammar when you're trying to speak. I think it's much easier to improve your vocabulary score than your grammar score.</p>
<p><strong>Remember:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Grammar is only 25% of your speaking score.</li>
<li>If you are thinking too much about grammar, you will lose fluency.</li>
<li>If you try to use memorised grammatical structures, your speech will not sound 'natural'.</li>
<li>You will not avoid small grammar mistakes unless you have lived in an English speaking country for many years.</li>
</ul>
<p>I've taught many students who have achieved a score of 7 or higher, and they all made small grammar mistakes. They got their high scores because we focused on <em>vocabulary, ideas, opinions</em> and <em>fluency</em>.</p>
<p>Have a look through my speaking lessons, and you'll notice that the focus is usually on vocabulary.</p>

<li>But if the meaning is <em><strong>'onwards'</strong></em> or <em><strong>'towards'</strong></em>, we should use the two words <em><strong>'on to'</strong></em>. In my example ("on to a dual carriageway"), the meaning was 'towards', not 'to a position on the surface of'.</li>

	<p>
				<p>Here are my (band 9) sample answers to the 'money' questions that I shared a few weeks ago.</p>
<p><em><strong>1. Why is it important for people to save some of their money?</strong></em></p>
<p>In the long term I think it's important to save for retirement, but it's also a good idea to have a certain amount of money saved so that you can deal with unexpected problems in the less distant future. For example, I've learnt to put some money aside for car repairs, and this came in useful recently when I needed to have my car's brake pads changed. If I hadn't had savings, the cost of getting my car repaired could have sent me into the red.</p>
<p><em><strong>2. In your view, should children be taught how to manage money?</strong></em></p>
<p>Not at school, no. I believe it's the job of parents to gradually teach children that kind of thing, or perhaps there's no need for anyone to teach children about money because they learn about it naturally as they grow up. For example, I remember being given money to buy sweets or an ice cream when I was a child, and I soon learnt what I could afford and what I couldn't.</p>
<p><em><strong>3. Do you think that girls are better at saving money than boys?</strong></em></p>
<p>I've never thought about that before. I don't see any reason why girls would be better savers than boys or vice versa. I suppose it depends more on the personality of each individual and what their interests are. For example, a child who likes cheap toys might not think about saving, whereas a child who wants to buy something expensive, like a bike or a games console, might summon the willpower to save up!</p>

				<p><em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Note: I'm re-posting this lesson because people keep asking me about 'difficult' words.</span></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Here's a useful question from a student who asked about "difficult" words and how to learn new vocabulary:</strong></em></p>
<p>Hi Simon. Reading your blog and studying your ebook, I’ve noticed your English is perfect, but you don’t use difficult words. Also, regarding the process of learning new words, some teachers say that we should write them on cards and write the adjective, noun, verb associated with the new word. Do you think this is a good idea?</p>
<p><em><strong>Here's my answer:</strong></em></p>
<p>I don't believe in the idea of a "difficult word" - any individual word can be learnt easily. What is difficult is using words together in phrases. So, I tell my students not to write down individual words, but to investigate how words work in real contexts. Instead of writing single words on cards, I'd write phrases or even sentences in a notebook. It's definitely a good idea to look for associated nouns, verbs and adjectives, but always try to find examples of how those words are used (just search for them on the Internet). Remember: it's easy to understand a word, but it's not so easy to use it in a range of full sentence contexts.</p>

				<p>Model essays can be extremely useful because they show you what you are aiming for, and they contain good vocabulary and correct grammar. However, the model essays in some IELTS books seem to confuse students because they are written in too many different ways (so the 'method' isn't clear).</p>
<p>Although there is no 'right way' to write an essay, I think that you should find <em><strong>one</strong></em> way and stick with it. If you read a model essay that is written in a different way, don't worry! Use the essay for ideas and vocabulary, but don't change your method. Maybe you could even rewrite the model essay using <em><strong>your</strong></em> method.</p>

	<p>
				<p>In the IELTS speaking test, 25% of your score is for pronunciation. Many students confuse '<span style="text-decoration: underline;">pronunciation</span>' with '<span style="text-decoration: underline;">accent</span>'. These are <em><strong>not</strong></em> the same thing!</p>
<p>Nobody expects you to speak with a perfect British English accent. In fact, the examiner will not judge your accent at all.</p>
<p>Your pronunciation score is based on these things:</p>
<ul>
<li>clarity (speaking clearly)</li>
<li>speed (not too fast, not too slow)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.englishclub.com/esl-articles/199810.htm" target="_self">word stress</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.englishclub.com/pronunciation/sentence-stress.htm" target="_self">sentence stress</a></li>
<li>intonation (the rise and fall of your voice)</li>
</ul>
<p>It's not easy to improve these things quickly or through deliberate practice. Good pronunciation is usually the result of lots of listening and copying. My tip is: stop worrying about your accent, and focus on speaking clearly.</p>

	<p>
				<p>A student asked me about the use of 'being' in the following sentence.</p>
<p><em>"There is a danger of nuclear weapons <span style="text-decoration: underline;">being</span> obtained by terrorists."</em></p>
<p>Here's my (updated) explanation:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, imagine that the simplest version of this sentence is this: <span style="color: #7f007f;"><strong>"There is a danger of x"</strong></span> (in which x is a noun).</li>
<li>Now we can consider <span style="color: #7f007f;"><strong>"nuclear weapons being obtained by terrorists"</strong></span> as a big noun phrase.</li>
<li>The <span style="color: #7f007f;"><strong>"being obtained"</strong></span> part of this phrase can be called a passive gerund. It is not a verb or verb phrase, so the word "are" (are being) is <em><strong>not</strong></em> missing and cannot be added.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: When we use the phrase "there is a danger of...", there is a future implication. So, "there is a danger of x" means "there is a danger that x will happen".</p>
<p>Therefore, our sentence really means this:<br>- There is a danger that nuclear weapons <em><strong>will be</strong></em> obtained by terrorists" OR<br>- There is a danger that terrorists will obtain nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>Thanks to Morteza and Oleg for pushing me towards a better explanation!</p>

	<p>
				<p>Last Friday I asked you to think about the topic below.</p>
<p><em>Describe a time when you saved up some money to buy something special.</em></p>
<p>Here are some ideas from one of my video lessons (speaking lesson 5 on <a href="http://subscriptions.viddler.com/SimonCorcoran">this webpage</a>). In the lesson I describe a 'smartwatch' and suggest the following vocabulary 'themes':</p>
<p><strong>Electronic watch 'features' theme</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>smartwatch</li>
<li>synchronise with phone / computer</li>
<li>contacts, photos, emails</li>
<li>store music</li>
<li>receive notifications</li>
<li>search the web</li>
<li>it responds to voice commands</li>
<li>make ‘contactless’ purchases</li>
<li>track exercise goals</li>
<li>fashion accessory</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Electronic watch 'useful' theme</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>various features and functions</li>
<li>organise my life</li>
<li>work, appointments, social life</li>
<li>check calendar at a glance</li>
<li>set reminders and notifications</li>
<li>practical, functional, convenient</li>
<li>the ultimate in portable devices</li>
<li>instant access to…</li>
<li>couldn’t live without it</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm sure you could use some of this vocabulary to describe "something special that you saved money to buy".</p>

	<p>
				<p>In the comments below a recent lesson, I noticed that several people had written "I'm agree with you". This is incorrect.</p>
<p>You can't say "I'm agree" in English. You must say <strong>"I agree"</strong>.</p>
<p>I think this mistake is caused by people translating from their own languages. For example, I know that in French and Spanish, the verb 'be' is used when people want to say that they agree, so it looks something like "I am agree" or "I am agreed". It's not the same in English.</p>
<p>In English, we simply use 'agree' as a <strong>normal verb</strong>: I agree, I prefer, I like...</p>

	<p>
				<p>In Thursday's lesson I told you <em><strong>not</strong></em> to use words like <em>soar, rocket, shoot up, creep up, dive</em> and <em>plummet</em> in IELTS writing task 1.</p>
<p><strong>But what's wrong with those words?</strong></p>
<p>The problem with those words is that they are <em>too figurative</em> for writing task 1. Think about the normal use of these verbs (e.g. the bird soared into the air, the climber plummeted to his death). If you use these words to describe figures on a graph, it seems too sensational or exaggerated. This is why I prefer to stick with <em>increase, decrease, rise</em> and <em>fall</em>.</p>
<p><strong>So can we ever use these words to describe figures?</strong></p>
<p>If you're writing for a newspaper, yes you can! You'll often see phrases like this in newspapers: house prices soared, share prices plummeted, the price of petrol crept up. Newspapers and magazines love idiomatic and descriptive language, but this style does not suit academic graph descriptions.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here's a recent exam topic that a few people told me about:</p>
<p><em><strong>Describe a time when you saved up some money to buy something special.</strong></em><br><em><strong>You should say</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>- what you wanted to buy</strong></em><br><em><strong>- why you wanted it</strong></em><br><em><strong>- how you saved your money</strong></em><br><em><strong>- and explain how you felt when you finally bought the item.</strong></em></p>

	<p>
				<p>Someone asked me this question the other day: Why do you use a blog to teach IELTS?</p>
<p>Here's my answer:</p>
<p>The advantage of a blog is that it can keep going and going (unlike a book or a course). Over the years, this blog has evolved as I've learnt more about students' problems, and as I've gradually refined my IELTS preparation methods.</p>
<p>The disadvantage of the blog is that the lessons aren't in a particular order, so there isn't a starting point or a step-by-step progression. However, I find this lack of structure interesting. I don't think we always need to study in a perfectly organised way. Perhaps the act of searching through the lessons and reading them <em><strong>in your own unique order</strong></em> makes the study process more engaging and creative.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here's a quick summary of my advice for IELTS speaking preparation.</p>
<p><strong>Part 1</strong></p>
<p>Make yourself a list of part 1 questions. Practise going through the full list, giving a simple one-sentence answer for each question. Record yourself and listen to your answers. Aim to answer without hesitation to demonstrate fluency. If you repeat this process every day, you should see improvements.</p>
<p><strong>Part 2</strong></p>
<p>Prepare sample answers <em><strong>in written form</strong></em> for the <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2016/01/ielts-speaking-part-2-use-and-adapt-main-topics.html">six main topic areas</a>. Ask a teacher or native English speaker to help you to improve your descriptions, by correcting mistakes and adding better vocabulary ideas. Practise those six descriptions until you can 'perform' them without needing to read your notes. Record yourself, analyse your performance and keep practising and perfecting until you have really mastered the six topics. Then move on to other less common topics and try to do the same.</p>
<p><strong>Part 3</strong></p>
<p>Make yourself a list of part 3 questions. Practise going through the list, giving <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2017/06/ielts-speaking-part-3-answer-explain-example.html">3-step answers</a>. Force yourself to give a direct answer, explanation and example every time. When this way of answering starts to feel easy and natural, because you've created a habit, you can experiment with <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2015/03/ielts-speaking-part-3-long-answer-technique.html">4-step answers</a>. Record yourself, analyse your answers and repeat the process. Don't move on to any new questions until you feel that you've 'mastered' your original list.</p>

	<h4><a href="https://www.ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2018/05/ielts-speaking-part-2-maths-lesson-answer.html">IELTS Speaking Part 2: 'maths lesson' answer</a></h4>
	<p>
				<p>Here's the task that I showed you last week:</p>
<p><em style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;">Describe something important that you learned in a maths lesson at primary school.</em></p>
<p>And here's my sample answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m going to talk about learning the multiplication tables for the numbers 1 to 12, which I remember doing in the penultimate year of primary school, when I was maybe 9 years old. As children, we called these the ‘times tables’.</li>
<li>As far as I remember, we started with the number 2, and we learnt to multiply this number by each of the numbers from 1 to 12. Our teacher taught us to go through the tables speaking aloud; for example: 1 times 2 is 2, 2 times 2 is 4, 3 times 2 is 6 etc. We gradually worked our way through the tables for all of the numbers, and we learnt the answers by heart. I think the teacher also gave us regular tests to make sure that we had learnt the tables properly.</li>
<li>I’m not sure whether I really understood at the time why it was important to learn the ‘times tables’ by rote. But I think I enjoyed the challenge, and I was keen to get good marks in our tests. I also liked my teacher and wanted to do well for her.</li>
<li>Many years later I realise how important it is to have the basic multiplication tables ingrained in my mind. It’s useful to be able to do quick calculations without having to think. Recently, for example, I needed to multiply 6 by 7 for some reason - I can’t even remember why - and the answer 42 just popped into my head. Another instance that I can think of is when I’m calculating bill payments, earnings and savings over a 12-month period, and I find myself using the ‘12 times table’. In these situations, I’m glad that my primary school teachers were so insistent about learning to multiply by heart.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em><br>I didn't have the full question, so I decided to tell a story in my own way. Did you learn any useful words or phrases from my description?</p>

	<p>
				<p>With yesterday's advice in mind, let's look at some reasons why students don't write clear, coherent essays:</p>
<ol>
<li>They don't have a <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2018/03/ielts-writing-task-2-my-mental-picture.html">mental picture</a> of what they are aiming to produce.</li>
<li>They don't take the time to think about the question before they start writing.</li>
<li>They don't spend enough time planning. A few ideas are not enough; a good essay plan should be detailed and organised. Do some "clear thinking" before you start writing!</li>
<li>They are thinking about the big words, complex grammar and memorised phrases that they hope to use in the essay, instead of thinking about how to answer the question. You can't think clearly about the question if your brain is focused on these other things.</li>
<li>They are thinking clearly in their own languages, but they are not able to translate these ideas into 'natural' English.</li>
</ol>
<p>Can you see how important 'clear thinking' is? Everything that you write is a manifestation of the thoughts in your head. In other words, your writing demonstrates exactly how clear your thinking is.</p>

	<p>
				<p>On Tuesday I used part of a very interesting speech by a university professor. I could sum up his message in this way:</p>
<p><em>There's no difference between thinking and writing. We should teach people to write well so that they learn to think well.</em></p>
<p>Of course, the opposite must also be true: If you want to <strong><em>write</em></strong> clearly and coherently, you need to <em><strong>think</strong></em> clearly and coherently.</p>
<p>Ask yourself this: When I'm writing an IELTS essay, does my thinking feel clear, coherent and organised? Or do I feel confused and disorganised?</p>

	<p>
				<p>I often use the phrasal verb 'tighten up' when I'm talking about improving essays. Here's what I mean when I use this verb:</p>
<p>- Make your writing clear, concise and succinct<br>- Remove anything that is irrelevant or vague<br>- Avoid unnecessary repetition<br>- Check that each sentence follows on logically from the sentence before it<br>- Make sure that your sentences&nbsp;<a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2015/08/ielts-advice-paragraph-movement.html">move your paragraphs forward</a></p>
<p>Think about the job of an editor (for a newspaper, magazine or book publisher). Editors check other people's writing and "tighten it up" so that it's easier to read. This is what you should try to do with your own writing.</p>

<p><em><strong>2. Do you ever draw or paint pictures now?</strong></em></p>
<p>No, I don't draw or paint these days, because there's never any need for me to create art at work, and I still don't enjoy art as a hobby.</p>
<p><em><strong>3. When was the last time you went to an art gallery or exhibition?</strong></em></p>
<p>I honestly can't remember the last time I went to any kind of art exhibition; I'm not much of an art fan, and I tend to go to music concerts, the cinema or the theatre instead of art shows.</p>
<p><em><strong>4. What kind of pictures do you like having in your home?</strong></em></p>

	<p>
				<p>A student called Wanda left a really good piece of advice in the comments area below Wednesday's lesson. I think it's worth repeating the advice so that more people read it.</p>
<p>Here's what Wanda wrote:</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><em><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; -moz-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">"The IELTS exam takes three hours, so to my mind you should be used to spending at least this long thinking in English every day. Anything less, and your mind will be exhausted with the effort on exam day."</span></em></span></p>

	<p>
				<p>In part 3 of the speaking test, you should try to give longer, more detailed answers. A great way to do this is by giving an example.</p>
<p>However, I've noticed that students often forget to give an example, even when I've just told them to answer using the three steps: 1) direct answer 2) explain 3) give an example.</p>
<p>Here's the solution to this problem: when answering in part 3, force yourself to say the words "for example". When I force my students to say these words, they always manage to find an example, and the result is that they always give better answers. Try it: just force yourself to say the words "for example", and see what happens.</p>

	<h4><a href="https://www.ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2018/03/ielts-advice-expose-your-weaknesses.html">IELTS Advice: expose your weaknesses</a></h4>
	<p>
				<p>In last Sunday's <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2018/03/ielts-advice-work-on-your-weaknesses.html">lesson</a> I suggested that you identify and work on your weaknesses. It's not always easy to identify your own weaknesses, so here are three tips to help you to expose them:</p>
<ol>
<li>Break each part of the test into smaller tasks. For example, you could spend time working on multiple choice questions in the reading test, idea generation for speaking part 2 (see yesterday's lesson), trend descriptions for writing task 1, or main body paragraphs for writing task 2. If you practise "small pieces" of the test, it's likely that you'll discover which "pieces" are problematic.</li>
<li>Put yourself under pressure. Some people only discover their weaknesses on the day of their real IELTS tests. A good way to create this kind of pressure at home is to give yourself less time than normal. For example, you could try to write a task 2 essay in just 30 minutes, finish a reading test in 50 minutes, or do a full listening test with no breaks (i.e. fast forward the recording every time there is a break). Going too quickly will expose your weak points, and then you can go back and analyse them.</li>
<li>Ask a teacher. If nothing else seems to work, you'll need to get some feedback from a teacher. Ask your teacher to identify the main weaknesses that are stopping you from getting a higher score.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Be careful with point 2 above. It's fine to test yourself or "go too quickly" <strong><em>occasionally</em></strong>, as a way to expose weaknesses, but you should spend most of your time preparing slowly and carefully.</p>

	<h4><a href="https://www.ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2018/03/ielts-speaking-part-2-ideas-practice.html">IELTS Speaking Part 2: 'ideas' practice</a></h4>
	<p>
				<p>In <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2018/03/ielts-advice-practise-generating-ideas.html">this lesson</a> I suggested that you spend some time thinking of ideas for writing task 2. You could follow the same advice for speaking part 2: take a list of questions, and spend some time brainstorming ideas for each one.</p>
<p>For example, here's a short list of speaking part 2 tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe a happy childhood memory.</li>
<li>Describe a present that you received as a child.</li>
<li>Describe a food that you enjoyed eating when you were a child.</li>
<li>Describe a favourite toy that you had when you were a child.</li>
<li>Describe a game that you enjoyed playing as a child.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that all five questions are about the topic of "childhood" - it might help to focus on one main topic area. Don't worry about giving full answers for now; just spend some time noting down your ideas and memories.</p>

	<p>
				<p>It's often the case that just one particular weakness is stopping people from getting a higher score. For example, the student that I wrote about yesterday had a problem with idea generation. His English was very good, but he struggled to think of good ideas, especially when under pressure.</p>
<p>I told him to stop writing essays and to spend time working only on his weakness (as described yesterday). In other words, we <em><strong>identified</strong></em> a weakness, we <em><strong>isolated</strong></em> it, and then we came up with a simple <em><strong>action plan</strong></em> to tackle it. Perhaps you can do the same.</p>

	<p>
				<p>I got chatting to a student in a café the other day, and he told me that his big problem was not being able to think of good ideas for writing task 2.</p>
<p>When I asked the student about how he practised for this part of the test, it became clear that he wasn't working on his weakness. He wasn't practising idea generation.</p>
<p>So here's a summary of the advice that I gave the student:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, watch my <a href="http://subscriptions.viddler.com/SimonCorcoran/fkvcqe">video lesson</a> about planning ideas.</li>
<li>Then print a big list of questions, like <span class="asset  asset-generic at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c01bb09fe099c970d img-responsive"><a href="http://ielts-simon.com/files/question-list.pdf">this one</a>.</span></li>
<li><span class="asset  asset-generic at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c01bb09fe099c970d img-responsive">The next time you're sitting in a café, take your list out and try brainstorming ideas for two or three of the questions.</span></li>
<li><span class="asset  asset-generic at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c01bb09fe099c970d img-responsive">Don't write an essay or even any sentences. Just note down ideas on a piece of paper.</span></li>
<li><span class="asset  asset-generic at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c01bb09fe099c970d img-responsive">If you can't think of good ideas in English, try thinking in your own language. Don't translate the ideas into English at this stage. Your only aim is to turn on the creative part of your brain!</span></li>
<li><span class="asset  asset-generic at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c01bb09fe099c970d img-responsive">Start with your real opinion. Ask yourself what you really think about the topic; if you were debating the topic with a friend, what would you say?</span></li>
<li><span class="asset  asset-generic at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c01bb09fe099c970d img-responsive">Start with examples. If the topic is 'unhealthy food', think about McDonald's or Coca Cola. If the topic is 'work', think about doctors, teachers, computer programmers etc.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="asset  asset-generic at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c01bb09fe099c970d img-responsive">Imagine spending 15 minutes each day just thinking of ideas, questioning your own opinions, and making notes on a wide range of IELTS topics. With practice, I'm sure you can turn a weakness into a strength!</span></p>

	<p>
				<p>Many students are concerned that the language they use might be too 'simple', so they try to find more 'difficult' words or phrases.</p>
<p>In my opinion, words and phrases are never 'difficult' in the way that a subject like mathematics can be difficult. Anyone can understand and learn a word or phrase. What <em><strong>is</strong></em> difficult about learning a language is <em><strong>building a large&nbsp;<a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2011/10/ielts-advice-your-repertoire.html">repertoire</a></strong></em> of words and phrases that you can use flexibly to express a wide variety of ideas.</p>
<p>Examiners don't really think in terms of 'simple' and 'difficult'. They look for:</p>
<ul>
<li>range and variety of vocabulary</li>
<li>detailed explanation of relevant ideas</li>
<li>ability to put groups of words together correctly (e.g. collocation)</li>
<li>accurate use of small words (e.g. articles) as well as big words</li>

	<h4><a href="https://www.ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2018/03/ielts-speaking-part-3-common-question-types.html">IELTS Speaking Part 3: common question types</a></h4>
	<p>
				<p>Here are 3 common question types that the examiner could ask you:</p>
<ol>
<li>Compare and contrast</li>
<li>Give an opinion</li>
<li>Imagine</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, if the topic is 'cities', the examiner might ask:</p>
<ol>
<li>How is life different in cities compared to rural areas? (<em>compare</em>)</li>
<li>How do you think life in big cities could be made easier? (<em>opinion</em>)</li>
<li>What do you think cities will be like in 50 years time? (<em>imagine</em>)</li>
</ol>
<p>In my answers below I've underlined a few 'markers' that show comparisons, opinions and future predictions.</p>
<ol>
<li>Firstly, the cost of living in cities is much <span style="text-decoration: underline;">higher</span>. Housing is much <span style="text-decoration: underline;">more</span> expensive in cities <span style="text-decoration: underline;">compared to</span> rural areas; everything costs more. I think life in cities is more difficult. There are more people, so there's more competition for jobs. Life is a lot <span style="text-decoration: underline;">slower</span> in rural areas, everyone knows each other and there's a sense of community. I don't think rural areas experience the social problems that you find in cities, like crime and homelessness.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In my opinion</span> cities <span style="text-decoration: underline;">need to</span> be well-planned. Good public transport can definitely make life easier because there are so many people and it can be really stressful just to move around. Public areas like parks are also <span style="text-decoration: underline;">important</span> because people need space to relax, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I think</span> cities should be made into healthier places to live and work.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I imagine</span> cities <span style="text-decoration: underline;">will</span> be less polluted because we'll have electric cars and better public transport. More people <span style="text-decoration: underline;">might</span> work from home so maybe cities won't be so busy. But I think there will probably still be problems because more and more people are migrating to cities. So <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I'm not so optimistic</span> about issues like crime, homelessness and unemployment.</li>

	<p>
				<p>Yesterday I mentioned that people are writing some really intelligent comments below lessons here on the blog. Today I'd like to share a comment written by Kali. I think this is a great example of 'deep work'.</p>
<p>Kali took five of my task 2 essays and shared the following analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each essay averaged 13 sentences, the longest 32 words, the shortest 10 words.</li>
<li>One in three sentences was complex in the sense that it contained a subordinate, noun, or relative clause.</li>
<li>On average ONE of the following: "Though/although", "because", "whereas", "while", "whilst",or "if" occurred ONCE per essay.</li>
<li>"In conclusion" ONCE per essay.</li>
<li>"Also" almost ONCE per essay.</li>
<li>Either "On the other hand" or "however" ONCE per essay.</li>
<li>"This" (as a cohesion device) in two out of five essays.</li>
<li>"but" occurred on average once or twice per essay.</li>
<li>"or" comes up about twice per essay.</li>
<li>"and" seven times per essay on average.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's Kali's summary of the above analysis:</p>
<p><em>In my view, what this demonstrates is that Simon's writing is both normal, and that its simplicity is deceptive. There is comparatively little reliance on connective adverbs, such as "moreover" or "consequently", at the start of sentences. Although some sentences are technically and grammatically more complex, the complexity passes unnoticed to the average reader.</em></p>
<p>If you find this kind of analysis useful, read the third comment below <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2018/01/ielts-writing-task-1-paraphrasing-practice.html">this lesson</a> (written by csaj). This is a great example of how Google Books and Ngrams can help us.</p>

	<p>
				<p><em>Describe a time you travelled by public transport. You should say</em></p>
<p><em>- what type of public transport you used</em><br><em>- where you travelled from and to</em><br><em>- what you did during the journey</em><br><em>- and explain how you felt about travelling in this way</em></p>
<p><strong>I've tried to give my answer (below) in the form of an 'anecdote':</strong></p>
<p>I’m going to describe a train journey that I took last year between Manchester and London. I’ve made the same journey many times, but I’ll never forget this particular time because something happened that I wasn’t expecting.</p>
<p>It was a Sunday morning and I was due in London that afternoon. There was no traffic at all as I drove in to Manchester, and I was expecting a nice, peaceful trip on a half-empty train. But my first surprise came when I tried to print my prepaid ticket at one of the ticket machines: there wasn’t a reserved seat number on my ticket, which meant that I would have to find an available seat. I was still wondering about this when I heard loud voices and singing coming from the main station concourse. Suddenly I realised what was happening - I was going to be on a train full of football fans travelling to a big match!</p>
<p>Luckily I managed to find a seat before the train filled up. However, the noisy fans made sure that I couldn’t concentrate on any work; I couldn’t even read the newspaper without being interrupted by laughter, singing and football stories. In the end, I just sat and relaxed with a cup of coffee, watching and listening to the excited fans.</p>
<p>All in all, it wasn’t a bad journey; I love travelling by train and at least I had a comfortable seat so that I could sit back and relax for a couple of hours. I would have preferred a quieter trip, but the football fans were all friendly and good-natured, so I can’t really complain. Even so, I made sure that I avoided them on the way home later that day!</p>

	<p>
				<p>Native speakers instinctively know which words work well together. In our native languages, we don't usually need to think about grammar because we have a vast store of 'correct' collocations and phrases in our heads; some people refer to these as 'chunks' of language. It's incredible how quickly our brains are able to retrieve these 'chunks' and piece them together to form sentences and express ideas.</p>
<p>Unfortunately most of us don't use our brains in this way when we're learning a second language. We learn grammar rules and individual words, and we fall into the trap of translating from our native languages. As a result, we often make the wrong word choices and produce 'unnatural collocations'.</p>
<p>Part of the solution to this problem, in my view, is to become a collocations collector! Collect groups of words that native speakers actually use (see yesterday's lesson for some examples). Write them in a notebook, reread them regularly, and try to use them when you're speaking or writing,</p>
<p><em>Note: How many collocations can you find in the paragraphs above?</em></p>

				<p>An anecdote is a "short amusing or interesting story about a real incident" (according to my computer's dictionary). If you can think of an anecdote in part 2 of your speaking test, you'll find the task much easier.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise:</strong><br>Look again at the 'public transport' task in last Friday's <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2018/02/ielts-speaking-part-2-public-transport.html">lesson</a>.

	<p>
				<p>It was interesting to read about people's procrastination problems in the comments below last Saturday's <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2018/02/ielts-advice-procrastination.html">lesson</a>. I think we all experience these problems when we're trying to do something difficult.</p>
<p>Here are five tips that help me to fight procrastination:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Just make a start.</strong> If you've been procrastinating about writing an essay, for example, make it your goal to write the first sentence only. The hardest thing is to get started, and the idea of writing a full essay can be daunting. Put this idea out of your mind, and focus instead on writing just one sentence.</li>
<li><strong>Find a nice place.</strong> Whenever I have some difficult writing to do, I find it much easier to get started if I'm sitting in a café with a cup of coffee. It doesn't feel like such hard work when you're in a nice environment.</li>
<li><strong>Aim lower (at first).</strong> Sometimes our frustration is caused by the high expectations that we have. Instead of jumping into a 10-hour-a-day study programme, it's better to start with 10 minutes, then gradually do more each day.</li>
<li><strong>Get some help.</strong> It's hard to study alone, so try to find a study partner, teacher or someone who can occasionally check your progress and give you advice.</li>
<li><strong>Form a daily habit.</strong> For me, doing something every day is the ultimate weapon in the fight against procrastination. Doing something once a week (or even 5 times a week) doesn't work as well. There's something magic about daily practice: when a daily action becomes as normal as brushing your teeth, big changes start to happen!</li>
</ol>

	<p>
				<p>Here are my answers to the questions that I showed you last Friday:</p>
<p><em><strong>1) Do you use public transport? Why / why not?</strong></em></p>
<p>These days I mostly drive, and the main reason is that my usual journeys are much faster by car. For example, the half-hour drive that I do twice a week would take me three times as long by train and bus.</p>
<p><em><strong>2) Which type of public transport do you prefer? Why?</strong></em></p>
<p>I definitely prefer the train. I like being able to stroll up and down, and on some trains I can book a seat with a table and a socket, so that I can do some work.</p>
<p><em><strong>3) How good is the public transport where you live?</strong></em></p>
<p>It's quite good. There's a train station not far from my house, and it's a direct line straight into the city centre. There are lots of bus routes too, and there's even a tram network in the centre of Manchester.</p>
<p><em><strong>4) Do you think people should use public transport more? Why / why not?</strong></em></p>
<p>Yes, as long as it's convenient for them. Public transport is obviously more environmentally friendly than private cars, so we could reduce air pollution by using it more.</p>

	<p>
				<p>I'll share some tips on beating procrastination next weekend, but I thought I'd say just one thing about it today, and it's something positive.</p>
<p>The positive thing about procrastination is that <em><strong>it tells you what is important.</strong></em> The more you procrastinate and leave something for later, the more important that task probably is in your life. So, let your procrastinating guide you towards what needs to be done, and begin to confront that task now. You'll feel much better if you do.</p>

				<p>Do you find it difficult to study as much as you would like to? Perhaps you make study plans but then decide to "do it later". This is what we call 'procrastination'.</p>
<p>Most of us procrastinate, put things off, or tell ourselves that we'll do it later, especially when the task is difficult and we feel stuck.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here are the questions from last Friday, with my sample answers below. Notice that all of my answers contain three sentences.</p>
<p>1) In your country, what possessions are considered "status symbols"?<br>2) Do you think we place too much importance on possessions?<br>3) Do you think things were different 50 years ago?</p>
<p><strong>1) Answer, examples, explain:</strong></p>
<p>The typical status symbols in my country are things like big houses, expensive luxury cars or sports cars, and anything made by certain brands. For example, a new Ferrari or a Rolls Royce or a Rolex watch would definitely be considered status symbols. I suppose the reason why these possessions are seen in this way is because you have to be very wealthy to buy them, so they show other people that their owner is rich and successful.</p>
<p><strong>2) Answer, explain, example:</strong></p>
<p>Probably, yes. Many people are obsessed with showing off their new mobile phone or wearing the latest fashions. I think it's a problem for teenagers because there's a lot of peer pressure to follow fashion or buy the latest gadget that their friends have got.</p>
<p><strong>3) Answer, example, further explanation:</strong></p>
<p>Yes, maybe people were less materialistic, and I think they bought things that lasted longer. For example, my grandparents always talked about how they repaired things rather than throwing them away. Maybe brands and advertising weren't as powerful as they are now.</p>

	<p>
				<p>What would you do if you didn't understand the phrase "status symbols" (see yesterday's questions)? Would you guess, or would you ask the examiner?</p>
<p>The good news is that it's fine to ask the examiner for a bit of help <strong><em>in part 3</em></strong> of the speaking test <em><strong>(but not in parts 1 or 2)</strong></em>. So here's what you could say:</p>
<p><em>"Sorry, I'm not sure what you mean by status symbols."</em></p>
<p>The examiner will then try to ask the question in a different way, and the fact that you didn't understand these two words won't affect your score.</p>

				<p>Let's look at the grammar problems in last Sunday's <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2018/01/ielts-grammar-correct-the-mistakes.html">lesson</a>.</p>
<p>1. Don't write "growth population". You need to write "population growth".<br>2. You can't write "the number of public" because 'public' is uncountable.<br>3. Don't write "there was" when giving a future prediction.<br>4. You can't put "alike" before a noun, so "alike growth rate" is wrong.<br>5. Don't put "is" after a plural (prospects is), and you can't write "by meanwhile".</p>
<p>Here are my corrected versions of the sentences:</p>
<ol>
<li>Population growth in England is projected at 5.9%.</li>
<li>The number of people living in England is projected to grow by 5.9%.</li>
<li>There will be a 5.9% increase in England's population.</li>
<li>There are similar population growth trends in Northern Ireland and Scotland.</li>
<li>The population is expected to grow by 3.2% in Scotland and by 4.3% in Northern Ireland.</li>

				<p>I think it's important to remember that you can never be 100% prepared for any exam. One of the aims of an exam is to take you out of your 'comfort zone' in order to find the limit of your current ability. There will always be surprises and difficult questions; otherwise everyone would get full marks.</p>
<p>So, don't worry if there are topics that you haven't studied, or words that you don't understand, and try not to get too nervous or frustrated. Just keep working hard, do your best, and try to enjoy the challenge of the exam!</p>

	<p>
				<p>Let's look again at the description of a tree that I shared in last Friday's <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2018/01/ielts-speaking-part-2-tree-description.html">lesson</a>. I've already listed the good vocabulary from the description <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2018/01/ielts-vocabulary-review-of-this-week.html">here</a>, so let's focus on grammar.</p>
<p>Here are three grammar points from my description:</p>
<p>1) I used a variety of verb tenses</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Future:</strong> I'm going to talk about / I'll also describe</li>
<li><strong>Present simple:</strong> This is / they are / I have / it symbolises</li>
<li><strong>Past simple:</strong> I went, it was</li>
<li><strong>Present perfect:</strong> that I've ever seen</li>
</ul>
<p>2) I also used some passives</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Present:</strong> it's thought to be, they can be seen, they are commonly found, wood is used, stories are associated with it</li>
<li><strong>Present perfect:</strong> has traditionally been used, hasn't been used, has become known</li>
</ul>
<p>3) I used pronouns to refer back to nouns already used</p>
<ul>
<li>a tree called the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Major Oak</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">This</span> is..., <span style="text-decoration: underline;">it</span>'s thought to be...</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Oaks</span> are very common... <span style="text-decoration: underline;">they</span> can be seen...</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sherwood Forest</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">which</span> is</li>
<li>a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">wood</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">that</span> has traditionally been used</li>
<li>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">oak tree</span> is important... because <span style="text-decoration: underline;">it</span> symbolises... <span style="text-decoration: underline;">its</span> traditional role</li>
<li>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Major Oak</span> is famous... <span style="text-decoration: underline;">stories</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">that</span> are associated with <span style="text-decoration: underline;">it</span></li>

	<p>
				<p>Here's the question that we've been looking at recently:</p>
<p><em><strong>Describe a plant, flower or tree that is famous or important in your country.</strong></em><br><em><strong>You should say</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>- what type of plant, flower or tree it is</strong></em><br><em><strong>- where it grows or is usually seen</strong></em><br><em><strong>- how it is used in your country</strong></em><br><em><strong>- and why it is famous or important</strong></em></p>
<p>And here's my answer, using the plan from <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2017/12/ielts-speaking-part-2-10-minute-plan.html">this lesson</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m going to talk about oak trees, and I’ll also describe a specific example of a famous oak tree called the Major Oak. This is a huge tree in Sherwood Forest; it’s thought to be around 1000 years old, and I’d probably say that it’s the most impressive tree that I’ve ever seen.</li>
<li>Oaks are very common in England; they can be seen in fields and areas of woodland in the countryside, but they are also commonly found in parks and gardens in towns and cities. The Major Oak is in Sherwood Forest, which is near Nottingham. It stands out from the other oak trees because its trunk and branches are so wide and thick.</li>
<li>The wood from oak trees is used to make furniture; for example, I have an oak table, wardrobe and various other pieces of oak furniture at home. Oak is a strong and reliable wood that has traditionally been used in construction, for beams and other parts of the framework of houses and other buildings. The Major Oak obviously hasn’t been used in this way; it’s a tourist attraction that people visit and marvel at. For example, I went to see it on a school trip as a child.</li>
<li>The oak tree is important in England because it symbolises history, strength and reliability - probably because of its traditional role in construction. The Major Oak is famous for a completely different reason: it was supposedly Robin Hood’s hideout, so it has a kind of legendary or mythical status because of the stories that are associated with it. For this reason, and because of its age and unusual size, the Major Oak has become known as Britain’s favourite tree.</li>

	<p>
				<p>When learning something new, it's always best to start off slowly. If you want to master a skill, you need to learn the necessary techniques and practise them slowly before you can gradually build up speed.</p>
<p>This was the idea behind yesterday's lesson. Start by practising 10-minute plans for speaking part 2, and gradually reduce your planning time. If you practise enough, you'll become much better at thinking of ideas for this part of the speaking test, and you'll be able to use your minute more effectively on the day of your test.</p>
<p><em><strong>Tip:</strong></em> think about other parts of the IELTS test that you could practise slowly.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Yesterday I suggested that you try giving yourself more time to plan your part 2 answers. I tried giving myself 10 minutes to prepare ideas for the task below.</p>

<p>Here's my 10-minute plan:</p>
<ul>
<li>Oak tree, specifically the Major Oak in Sherwood Forest, a famous tree, tourist attraction, perhaps 1000 years old, huge trunk and branches.</li>
<li>Oaks grow all over the country, in parks etc., a common tree in England. Major Oak in Sherwood forest near Nottingham, unusual to see one so large, wide and thick.</li>
<li>Oak furniture, building beams, strong, reliable wood e.g. I have an oak table and wardrobe at home. Major Oak is a tourist attraction, people visit to marvel at it e.g. I went there on a school trip as a child.</li>
<li>Oaks symbolise history, strength, solidity, reliability, often used in building names e.g. Oak House. Major Oak was supposedly Robin Hood’s hideout, one of the biggest of this type of tree, old, historic, mythical status, legendary, Britain’s favourite tree, important to the local tourism industry.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that I took ideas from <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2017/12/ielts-reading-gap-fill-with-words-from-the-box.html">this</a> reading task. I'll use the plan above when I give my full sample answer in next Friday's lesson.</p>

	<p>
				<p>In part 2 of the speaking test you are given 1 minute to plan some ideas before you start speaking. Most people find it difficult to prepare good ideas in such a short time.</p>
<p>But what would happen if you had 5 minutes or even 10 minutes to plan your ideas? Would the extra planning time help you to prepare a much better answer? I think it should.</p>
<p>When practising at home, it's useful to experiment with the amount of planning time that you give yourself. For example, I'm going to give myself 10 minutes to plan ideas for the <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2017/12/ielts-speaking-part-2-plant-flower-or-tree.html">describe a plant</a> task.

	<p>
				<p>In the comments below Thursday's <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2017/12/ielts-writing-task-1-using-model-sentences.html">lesson</a>, I noticed a useful question from nav, and a very thoughtful response from Kati. It's great to see people discussing things and helping each other in the comments below my lessons!</p>
<p>To add to Kati's response, I'd like to say a little more about using 'model sentences'. First, I'll quickly repeat two useful points from Kati's comment:</p>
<ol>
<li>As Kati points out, the 'model sentences' exercise is probably more suited to writing task 1. This is because task 1 is quite predictable: we know that we'll have to describe trends, compare numbers or describe steps, so we can practise specific types of sentence for these purposes (e.g. 'while' sentences, 'respectively' sentences etc.).</li>
<li>There are some sentence types that I repeatedly use in writing task 2 (e.g. a 'while' sentence in the introduction). See Kati's comment for links to lessons about these sentence types.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now here's the final tip that I wanted to add:</p>
<p>Try not to confuse 'model' sentences with 'template' sentences. Examiners don't like essays that are full of memorised template language (read <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2017/09/ielts-advice-warning-about-templates.html">this warning</a>).</p>
<p>On the other hand, <em><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">any</span> correct sentence can be used as a model</strong></em>. For example, we could take the first sentence of today's lesson ("In the comments below Thursday's lesson, I noticed a useful question.") and invent a new sentence that follows a similar structure or pattern (e.g. On the way home from yesterday's lecture, I read an interesting article in the paper.).</p>
<p>I think you could turn this into a great daily exercise. But the aim would be to improve your English, not to collect template sentences for IELTS.</p>

				<p>On Thursday I suggested that you write some sentences using two of my own sentences as models. Here are the model sentences:</p>

	<p>
				<p>When I teach lessons here in Manchester, I always ask my students one question at the end of the day: What have you learnt? I ask the students to tell me <em><strong>the one key thing</strong></em> that they will remember the next day.</p>
<p>So, can I ask you the same question? If you have been following the lessons on this blog, what is the most useful thing that you have learnt?</p>

	<p>
				<p>Some students have the mistaken idea that examiners compare candidates, and that you'll therefore get a lower score if you use words or phrases that "too many other candidates use".</p>
<p><strong>This is not true!</strong></p>
<p>Examiners are trained to mark candidates according to a defined set of criteria. For example, look at these phrases from the band descriptors for band 7 in writing task 2:</p>
<p>- addresses all parts of the task<br>- presents a clear position throughout the response<br>- logically organises information and ideas<br>- there is clear progression<br>- uses a sufficient range of vocabulary to allow some flexibility</p>
<p>You <em><strong>won't</strong> </em>find phrases like this in the band descriptors:</p>
<p>- too many candidates use ..... in their essays<br>- reduce the score if the word ..... is used</p>
<p>Remember: the only comparison that examiners make is between your answer and the band descriptors.</p>

	<h4><a href="https://www.ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2017/12/ielts-speaking-part-2-sports-centre-answer.html">IELTS Speaking Part 2: 'sports centre' answer</a></h4>
	<p>
				<p>Reading the comments below last week's <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2017/11/ielts-speaking-part-2-place-of-entertainment.html#comments">lesson</a>, I can see that almost everyone chose to describe a sports centre. So here's my sample 'sports centre' description:</p>
<ul>
<li>The place of entertainment that I wish we had close to where I live is a sports centre. My ideal sports centre would have a gym, swimming pool, indoor and outdoor football pitches, courts for tennis, badminton and squash, and an all-purpose area for things like gymnastics and circuit training.</li>
<li>I can think of the perfect place for this facility: There’s a disused piece of land just down the road from where I live, where an old warehouse was knocked down. It’s near to the main road and the train station, so it would be easy for people to get to. There are plans to build houses on this plot of land, but I think a sports centre would be much better for local residents.</li>
<li>The good thing about a sports centre is that everyone can use it. There could be sports lessons and clubs for children and teenagers - things like swimming lessons and football team practice sessions. I’m sure many adults in my local area would join the gym, use the pool, and book the courts for games of tennis or badminton. The centre could even hold sports events, such as competitions, that would attract spectators as well as participants.</li>
<li>I think we need a good sports centre where I live because people currently have to travel to the next town if they want to find some of the facilities, activities, lessons and clubs that I’ve mentioned. I think a sports complex would give young people, in particular, something fun and productive to do in the evening and at weekends. Playing sport keeps people healthy and makes them feel happy, so I think a sports centre would brighten up my local area and improve our quality of life.</li>
</ul>

	<p>
				<p>Here's a piece of advice that I gave in a blog lesson a few years ago. I forgot that I had written this, and I think it's worth repeating:</p>
<p><em>In my experience, people become good at what they focus on. Are you constantly reading things in English, thinking about English, watching English videos, and making notes of anything new that you learn? If English is your main focus each day, I'm sure you'll improve.</em></p>

	<p>
				<p>Before you retake the exam, ask yourself some questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What specific areas have I worked to improve since my last exam?</li>
<li>How do I know that I have improved?</li>
<li>Can I get higher scores when I'm practising than the scores I need?</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's an example of an ideal response to these questions:</p>
<p><em>Since my last exam, I've been doing a lot of work to improve my 'main body' paragraphs for writing task 2. I now spend more time planning and organising my ideas before I start writing, so my paragraphs are a lot better. My teacher noticed this improvement and gave my most recent essay a band 7. I only need a 6.5.</em></p>

<p>I think this is a nice technique that you could try. Start with a short "yes or no" answer (e.g. yes I do, no we don't, yes it certainly is...), and then explain your answer fully. Perhaps this technique will give you a few extra seconds to think before you give your full answer.</p>

				<p>Here are my answers to the 'rain' questions from last Friday's lesson. Remember: there's no need to show off in this part of the speaking test, so short, simple answers are best.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><em><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; -moz-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">1) Do you like rain? Why / why not?</span></strong></em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">No, not at all. It rains far too often in Manchester, where I live, and I'm fed up of it; I wish we had more sun!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><em><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; -moz-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">2) Do you think that rain affects people's mood?</span></strong></em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">Yes, definitely. I think rainy days and grey skies can be a bit sad and depressing. Where I live, people are much more cheerful when the sun comes out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><em><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; -moz-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">3) Does it often rain where you live?</span></strong></em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">Yes, unfortunately it does. As I said, Manchester is known for being a rainy place; you can't trust the weather here, because it can cloud over and start raining at any moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><em><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; -moz-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">4) Have you ever been caught in the rain without a coat or umbrella?</span></strong></em></span></p>

	<p>
				<p>In last Saturday's <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2017/11/ielts-advice-the-power-of-repetition.html">lesson</a> I asked you to think about the power of repetition in terms of developing your English skills. Here are a few ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Listening:</strong> Listen to the same recording several times, but focus on something different each time you listen. I explained this idea <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2017/10/ielts-listening-listen-again-and-again.html">here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Speaking:</strong> Compile a list of questions, and practise answering them every day. Record yourself so that you can listen for mistakes, and make notes about how you could improve. The aim is to 'master' your list of questions before you move on to anything new.</li>
<li><strong>Reading:</strong> If you've done all of the tests in the official Cambridge IELTS books, do them all again, and again! It doesn't matter if you remember some of the answers; you'll still learn something new each time you do the tests. If you can 'master' every reading test in the Cambridge books, I guarantee you'll get a high score in the test (but you'll only master them if you repeat each test several times).</li>
<li><strong>Writing:</strong> Instead of writing four different essays (which will probably all get the same score), try rewriting the same essay four times. Each time you rewrite the essay, try to improve one aspect of it. For example, for the first rewrite you could work on grammar, then the second time you could try to add more detailed explanation, then for the third rewrite you could improve the vocabulary or the coherence.</li>
</ul>
<p>Repetitive exercises might seem like boring hard work, but I believe that you can use them as a form of 'training' to develop both your English skills and your exam skills.</p>

	<p>
				<p>In Thursday's <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2017/11/ielts-writing-task-1-overview-highest-and-lowest.html">lesson</a> about IELTS writing task 1, I wrote that it's ok to describe the highest and lowest figures in your 'overview' paragraph. However, thanks to a comment by Erika, I've realised that I should add some extra advice or some warnings about this:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, it's important to remember that the best type of overview is one that describes overall trends, rather than specific details. The highest and lowest figures on a chart are normally considered to be specific details, so they shouldn't be your first choice for the overview.</li>
<li>If you can't see a clear general trend, it's ok to describe the highest and lowest, but don't mention any numbers.</li>
<li>Look for the highest and lowest category overall, rather than a single highest or lowest point. For example, if you're writing an overview about a line graph, it's fine to say that one of the lines was highest for most of the period, but don't describe any specific peaks (save them for the 'details' paragraphs).</li>
</ul>
<p>The overview that I wrote on Thursday was fine because the main aim of the chart was not to show trends. Picking out the most and least environmentally friendly country made sense in this particular case, and I didn't mention specific numbers.</p>
<p>However, I want to make it clear that <em><strong>describing the highest and lowest should not be your first choice method for writing the overview</strong></em>. Look for overall trends first.</p>
<p><strong>Task:</strong><br>Next Thursday I'll show you an alternative overview paragraph for the "waste chart" question. Can you suggest which "main or general points" about the chart I could include, instead of describing the highest and lowest?</p>

	<p>
				<p>I've been thinking about the power of repetition (in the sense of practising the same thing many times) this week.</p>
<p>Young children (the best language learners!) love watching the same cartoon or reading the same book again and again. But as adult language learners we rarely do this; we move on to the next thing too quickly.</p>
<p>Let's think about how we can build some repetition into our IELTS practice. I gave you some ideas yesterday and on Tuesday, but what else can we do? Feel free to share your thoughts in the comments below, and I'll give you my tips next weekend.</p>

	<p>
				<p>A student asked me for advice about avoiding pauses and hesitations in the speaking test. So here are some tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, don't worry <strong><em>too</em></strong> much about this. It's normal, even for native speakers, to pause or hesitate to some extent. The more you worry, the more likely you are to hesitate.</li>
<li>Don't "overthink". If you're thinking about grammar, linking or using "difficult" words, you're more likely to hesitate. Just focus on answering the question with the first idea that comes into your head.</li>
<li>Slow down. Many candidates speak too quickly; hesitation or repetition occurs because their brains can't work fast enough to keep up.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>But here's the main piece of advice: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">practise</span>!</strong></p>
<p>Make yourself a collection of IELTS speaking questions (from this site or from the Cambridge books), and practise answering them without hesitating.</p>
<p>And don't just practise this once. Go through your list of questions many times (every day if necessary), and you'll find that you gradually improve, both in terms of the quality of your answers and in terms of fluency and lack of hesitation. Maybe you could even record yourself, perhaps once a week, so that you can analyse your own performance.</p>

<ul>
<li>4 sentences: topic sentence then 3 advantages</li>
<li>Organising: I think... / First,... / Another benefit would be... / Finally, it seems to me that...</li>
<li>Good vocabulary: clear advantages, lack of traffic or industry, the average city, sense of community, everyone knows each other, the pace of life, laid back, the hustle and bustle</li>
<li>Interesting grammar: second sentence begins with a subordinate clause using 'with'</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Answer 3</strong></p>

	<p>
				<p>Here are my sample answers to the questions that I shared last week.</p>
<p><em><strong>1. What advantages does living in the countryside have, compared to living in a city?</strong></em></p>
<p>I think there are some clear advantages to living in the countryside. First, with the clean air and lack of traffic or industry, countryside areas are much healthier places than the average city. Another benefit would be the sense of community that comes with living in a small village where everyone knows each other. Finally, it seems to me that the pace of life in the countryside is slower, and the people are more laid back and friendly, compared to the hustle and bustle and the stress of city life.</p>
<p><em><strong>2. Have areas of countryside in your country changed since you were a child?</strong></em></p>
<p>No, they haven’t changed very much where I live. The reason for this is that countryside areas close to Manchester tend to be protected, and so construction is not allowed. For example, I live quite close to an area called the Peak District, and nothing seems to have changed there since I was young; the hills, paths and woodland areas are just as they were.</p>
<p><em><strong>3. Do you think that visits to the countryside should be something that schools offer to their children?</strong></em></p>
<p>Yes, I think it’s a great idea for schools to take children on trips to the countryside, especially if those children live in a large town or city. A visit to the countryside can be both relaxing and educational; children can go for walks in the fresh air, and at the same time see animals and plants that they may never have seen before. If schools don’t offer this opportunity, some children will never see life outside the city.</p>

				<p>Instead of trusting the grammar 'rules' that you find in a book, why not do your own investigating to see exactly how a word or phrase is used by native English speakers?</p>
<p>This is what I was encouraging you to do in yesterday's lesson about the word "alike". Instead of explaining the grammar rules, I simply showed you some correct sentences that contained the word. I gave you a 'model' or 'pattern' that you can use to make your own sentences.</p>

<p><strong>2. New sentence following <span style="text-decoration: underline;">exactly</span> the same pattern:</strong><br><em>Teaching assistants make lessons easier for students and teachers alike.</em></p>
<p><strong>3. New sentence with the same <span style="text-decoration: underline;">basic</span> pattern:</strong><br><em>The school website can be used by students, teachers and parents alike.</em></p>

<p>I’m going to describe a recent trip to a lovely place called the Tissington Trail. The Tissington Trail is a path or track that follows the route of a former railway line through beautiful countryside in the county of Derbyshire, here in the UK. The old railway line was taken up many years ago, and it was transformed into a recreational trail that is ideal for walkers, cyclists and horse riders.</p>
<p>I went to the Tissington Trail because we had some family members, my brother and sister-in-law and their daughter, staying with us over the weekend. They had come up to Manchester from London, and they wanted my wife and me to take them somewhere where they could breathe in some fresh countryside air and get away from the hustle and bustle of the city.</p>
<p>To reach the trail we had to park in Tissington itself, which is a charming, picturesque village. We hired some bicycles there and set off along the trail. It was an easy ride because the trail is mostly flat, with just a few gentle dips and inclines, and we were able to enjoy the stunning scenery as we passed through areas of woodland, a dramatic limestone ravine, and grassy meadows that were covered with colourful wild flowers.</p>
<p>The part of the day that I enjoyed the most was when we cycled through a historic railway tunnel on our bicycles. The tunnel has been fitted with a sound installation that plays eerie steam train noises as you pass through it; we all loved the idea that the sounds transport you back in time, and that you feel like you’re on an old steam train with its whistles and clunking machinery. It was a really nice day out, and we all enjoyed relaxing in the village tearoom at the end of our bike ride.</p>

	<p>
				<p>From the comments that people wrote below Wednesday's <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2017/09/ielts-writing-task-2-template-language.html">lesson</a>, it seems that many students find essay templates useful. However, I think it's important to repeat the warning that I gave in my own comment below that lesson.</p>
<p><strong>Warning about templates:</strong></p>
<p>Templates can certainly be useful, as they can help us to quickly organise our ideas. Also, it is inevitable that we will need to use some 'linking' words and phrases in our essays.</p>
<p>However, there is also a danger that people focus more on the template than on answering the question with good ideas. Templates and linking are <em><strong>not</strong></em> the secret to a high score in the writing test. They just do a simple job - they help you to organise your ideas, that's all. In the end, your score will depend on the quality of language that you use to <em><strong>express ideas</strong></em>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> simply to <em><strong>organise</strong></em> them.</p>
<p>So, learn some basic template / linking / organising language, but don't become obsessed with it. Spend most of your time working on topic vocabulary and your ability to express and develop "real" ideas.</p>

				<p>Did you notice the following sentence in Wednesday's essay? This is a nice way to introduce a personal example in the writing or speaking test.</p>
<p><em><strong>Having worked</strong> with children myself, I have learnt that clear expectations and boundaries are necessary.</em></p>
<p>Try creating your own personal examples with "having + past participle". You can also add the word "never" to make a negative. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Having lived</strong></em> abroad myself, I understand how important it is to learn about local customs.</li>
<li><em><strong>Having never tracked</strong></em> my fitness goals before, I found the new app really useful.</li>

<p><em><strong>Do you think people will watch less television in the future?</strong></em></p>
<p>Yes, I do think people will watch less television in the future, although that doesn't mean that they will watch fewer programmes or spend less time looking at screens. What I think will happen, and it's already happening, is that people will watch things on the Internet, through websites like YouTube. To use a personal example, I used to watch TV in the evenings, but now I often choose to stream videos, films and TV series through my computer instead.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Yesterday a student asked me to recommend a good grammar book. My answer to this question is that <em><strong>you don't need one</strong></em>. Let me explain my reasons for this view.</p>
<p>When I was at school, language learning meant studying two things: 1) grammar rules and 2) lists of vocabulary. The idea was that we should use the grammar rules to construct sentences, and the vocabulary would fill in the gaps. To me this seemed like a "mathematical" approach, where each grammar rule is like a formula. If you use a grammar book, you're probably following this method.</p>
<p>Nowadays I prefer a different approach, especially when teaching IELTS. Here are <strong><em>five reasons</em></strong> why I've moved away from the "grammar book" method:</p>
<ol>
<li>I believe that students can pass the test more quickly if they remember that grammar only accounts for 25% of their score, and they focus instead on the other <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2017/03/ielts-advice-the-other-75.html">75%</a>.</li>
<li>I believe that the "mathematical formula" approach causes people to create unnatural sentences.</li>
<li>I think that a better use of your time is to read and listen to as much native-speaker English as possible, so that you pick up the words, phrases and constructions that English speakers really use.</li>
<li>If you want to improve your grammar for IELTS, I recommend that you ask a teacher to highlight your mistakes. Instead of learning rules from a book, just aim to learn from the mistakes that you make, and therefore gradually "edit" your English.</li>
<li>You can check any grammar point with a quick search on the Internet. There's no need to slowly work through a book any more!</li>

	<p>
				<p>On Wednesday I wrote about 'template language', and there's a useful comment from sjm (another IELTS teacher) below the lesson. Here's what he said:</p>
<p><em>The problem with a lot of templates is that they contain too many memorised words and phrases. This then lowers the amount of topic vocabulary. Simon even uses a basic template (for example, he uses a five sentence body paragraph with a clear topic sentence, and similar linkers). However the key is that a template (or what I would call 'good organisation') does not dominate the essay. I always say from an examiner's point of view that candidates should keep memorised words and linkers to under 20% of the total word count.</em></p>
<p><strong>This made me think:</strong> Which words or phrases in some of my own essays could we highlight as 'template language' or 'good organisation'?</p>
<p>If you have time, make a list of the template / organising language in the two essays linked below. We can then compare the two lists.</p>

				<p>A useful way to practise IELTS speaking is to work on one main topic that might appear in all three parts of the test. For example, take the topic of <strong>"television"</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Part 1 questions:</strong></p>
<p>1. Do you like watching television?<br>2. How much time do you spend watching TV programmes?<br>3. What types of programmes do you prefer? Why?<br>4. Do you think it's bad for children to watch television?</p>
<p><strong>Part 2 task:</strong></p>
<p>Describe a television programme that you enjoyed watching. You should say<br>- what type of TV programme it was<br>- where you watched this programme<br>- what the programme was about<br>- and why you enjoyed watching it.</p>
<p><strong>Part 3 questions:</strong></p>
<p>1. Why do you think television is so popular among people of all ages?<br>2. Do you think people will watch less television in the future?<br>3. Do you see television as being educational or just a form of entertainment?</p>

<p>So, as part of your IELTS preparation, why not do a full day of testing at home, maybe once every two weeks? In the morning, start with a full listening test, then go straight on to a reading test, and follow that with both writing tasks. Have lunch, and then ask a friend or family member to be your speaking examiner in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Don't worry too much about your scores. Just get used to the difficulty of maintaining concentration for a full day. You'll be much better prepared when your exam day arrives if you've done a few of these mock test days at home.</p>

				<p>If a teacher, website, book or friend tells you that you <em><strong>must</strong></em> do a particular thing in the writing test, you can check the band descriptors to see whether it's true.</p>
<p>For example, I often receive questions like this:</p>
<p>My teacher told me that I <em><strong>must</strong></em> add a second sentence, containing a recommendation or prediction, to my task 2 conclusions? Is this true?</p>
<p>Here's my answer:</p>
<p>No, this is not true. There's nothing in the band descriptors about conclusions needing a recommendation or prediction. I think it's fine for teachers to say "this is how I think we should write a good conclusion", but they should make it clear that they are giving <em><strong>advice</strong></em> rather than stating a rule. <em><strong>If it's not in the band descriptors, it's not a rule</strong></em>.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Students often ask me what will happen if they do badly in part 2 of the speaking test. Is it still possible to get a high score?</p>
<p>Yes, in theory, it is still possible to get a reasonably high score (maybe band 7) if you do badly in part 2, but you would need to give excellent answers in part 3. In practice, candidates rarely recover from a bad part 2; I don't remember anyone who made a mess of part 2 but suddenly did a fantastic part 3.</p>
<p><em><strong>My advice:</strong></em> You should consider part 2 as the core of your speaking test. It's your best chance to show how good your English is, and it's the examiner's best chance to listen carefully to your use of language. In fact, it's probably the point at which most examiners get a clear idea of what score to give you.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Thanks to those of you who wished me a happy holiday! I'm feeling refreshed after a week off, and I thought it would be a good time to share a positive message that I received from a student, called Evan, who passed the IELTS test this month.</p>
<p>Here are the main parts of Evan's message:</p>
<p><em>Dear Simon,</em></p>
<p><em>I received my IELTS result this morning, and I am so happy to share with you that I've achieved my goal (7.0 for every part). I started taking IELTS in October 2016, and this is my 5th attempt. I would like to thank you very much for your useful lessons, tips and advice on your blog and your video course. I could not have got the results without it. I also want to share with you my experience, and hopefully this could once again prove that if one follows your method, he or she will succeed one day.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>My journey to achieving my IELTS goal has been very difficult and frustrating as I have been stuck with either writing or reading, especially writing. At some points I almost gave up and was thinking that IELTS may not be for me.&nbsp;But when I felt down, I read your posts and comments from successful takers, especially James Z, Chanaka and Kevin, which inspired me to continue. After my 4th attempt, I decided to take time off work so I could devote all my time to study. I studied from 9am to 6.30pm from Monday to Saturday for 5 weeks, and I wrote 34 essays and 11 letters following your method, and had 6 essays and 2 letters corrected. This helped identify my common mistakes, such as grammar error and word choice, and also to give me an idea of what a band 7.0 in writing would look like. I focused on learning topic vocabulary, and I practised the keyword technique for writing and listening. I strictly followed your advice for speaking part 1 (short and easy), part 2 (vocabulary theme) and part 3 (flow).</em></p>
<p><em>After all, I think that the key to IELTS band 7 includes the following:</em></p>
<ol>
<li><em>Hard work always pays off.</em></li>
<li><em>Trust ielts-simon.com's lessons, you don't need any others, even books. In fact, I only used the 12 Cambridge books and Official Practice Materials from ielts.org.</em></li>
<li><em>Don't waste time and money to take the test repeatedly. Instead, concentrate on language learning, and take the test when you are ready.</em></li>
<li><em>Spend more time on studying and practising than testing (I found this advice from you the most useful).</em></li>
<li><em>Have someone to check your work to identify common mistakes.</em></li>
</ol>
<p><em>Once again, thank you Simon very much and I really appreciate your work. Now,I can go back to work while preparing for the next chapter of my life with my IELTS result.</em></p>
<p><em>Regards,</em><br><em>Evan</em></p>

				<p>A student pointed out that I often use the word 'get' in my sample answers for IELTS speaking. For example, I wrote "get cash out" in my answer to question 4 in yesterday's lesson.</p>
<p>So, is it acceptable to use the word 'get' or is it too informal? Here's my answer:</p>
<p>The word 'get' is used so often in spoken English that no native speaker (or examiner) will even notice that you've used it. In fact, it might even help to make your speech sound more fluent and natural if you use 'get' in your speaking test.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> 'get' is fine in the speaking test, but I would normally avoid using it in the writing test.</span></p>

<p><em><strong>1) Do you have a favourite number or a number that is special to you?</strong></em></p>
<p>Yes, my favourite number is... because it's the day I was born on, and it's my lucky number.</p>
<p><em><strong>2) Do any numbers have special importance in your country?</strong></em></p>
<p>Yes. The number 7, for example, is supposed to be a special number in my country. It appears in so many places, like the seven days of the week, the seven main notes in music, and the seven ages of man that Shakespeare described.</p>
<p><em><strong>3) Are you good at remembering numbers? Why / why not?</strong></em></p>
<p>No, I'm not very good at remembering numbers. I don't think it's necessary to learn them by heart; I just save them on my phone.</p>
<p><em><strong>4) What numbers do people often have to memorise?</strong></em></p>
<p>The most important number to remember on a daily basis is the pin number for your bank card. Without this you can't pay for anything or get cash out.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Part 1 of the IELTS Speaking test is supposed to be easy. You don't need to give 'difficult' answers, and you should try to avoid making mistakes.</p>
<p><strong>Here are five simple rules for Speaking Part 1:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Keep your answers short, then stop with confidence.</li>
<li>Answer the questions using full sentences.</li>
<li>Use words from the examiner's question in your answer.</li>
<li>If possible, give a reason for your answer.</li>
<li>Don't forget to say "yes" or "no" when necessary.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Here's an example to illustrate these points:</strong></p>
<p>Do you like parks?</p>
<p>Yes, I like parks because they are great places to relax. If you live in a city, a park is often the only place where you can escape from the noise and the traffic.</p>

	<p>
				<p>By the end of speaking part 2, many IELTS candidates are exhausted and just want the exam to end. Consequently, they don't do as well as they could in part 3.</p>
<p>Ever since I noticed this problem as an examiner, I've told my students to make sure that they master the 3-step (or sometimes 4-step) method that I showed you <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2017/06/ielts-speaking-part-3-answer-explain-example.html">last Friday</a>.</p>
<p>Practise answering as many questions as you can using the "answer, explain, example (alternative)" method. If you can get into the habit of following these steps, you'll finish the speaking test strongly and make a good final impression on the examiner.</p>

				<p>My sample answers below all follow a 3-step structure: answer, explain, example.

Practise answering all part 3 questions in this way.</p>
<p><em><strong>1) How important is customer service for you?</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>(Answer)</strong> Customer service is really important for me because I like to feel welcome and valued as a customer. <strong>(Explain)</strong> If companies want us to use their products or services, I believe they should treat us well and therefore encourage us to return. <strong>(Example)</strong> For example, I have a favourite cafe where I like to go, and the friendly staff are the main reason that I’ve become a loyal customer.</p>
<p><em><strong>2) What can companies do to improve their customer service?</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>(Answer)</strong> I think managers need to train their employees to deliver great customer service. <strong>(Explain)</strong> There are lots of things that staff members can do, such as ensuring that customers are greeted in the right way, their problems are handled quickly, and they are asked for feedback. <strong>(Example)</strong> For example, the staff in my favourite cafe greet customers as soon as they come through the door, and they always check that we are happy before we leave.</p>
<p><em><strong>3) Why do you think employees sometimes don't provide good customer service?</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>(Answer)</strong> When employees’ treatment of customers isn’t good, I think it’s usually because they are unhappy doing their jobs. <strong>(Explain)</strong> This might be because they are treated badly by their managers, or because they haven’t been encouraged to take pride in their work. <strong>(Example)</strong> I remember in my first ever job, for example, I didn't like the work that I was given, and so I probably wasn’t as thoughtful or attentive as I should have been when I had to speak to customers.</p>

	<p>
				<p><strong>Studying alone</strong></p>
<p>It's certainly possible to prepare for the IELTS test alone. Every week I receive messages from people who tell me that they passed the test without attending any "normal" lessons. Some of them used only the free lessons here on the blog, while others found my video course to be exactly what they needed.</p>
<p><strong>Taking lessons</strong></p>
<p>On the other hand, not everyone likes working independently. You might find that attending English lessons with a teacher suits you better. The good news is that your teacher <em><strong>doesn't need to be an IELTS expert</strong></em>. You already have all the IELTS advice that you need here, so just try to find a good "general English" teacher.</p>
<p><strong>A middle point</strong></p>
<p>A "middle point" between the two paths above could be to study alone but get some feedback from an IELTS teacher every now and then. For example, you could study my blog lessons, and then <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2016/10/essay-correction-and-speaking-practice.html">get an essay checked</a> or try taking a realistic <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2016/10/essay-correction-and-speaking-practice.html">online speaking test</a> with one of my colleagues. If you're working alone, a teacher's feedback will make sure you're on the right track.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Last week I gave you a list of "theme" vocabulary for the question below.</p>
<p><em><strong>Describe a time when you received good service in a restaurant or cafe.</strong></em><br><em><strong>You should say</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>- when this was</strong></em><br><em><strong>- what kind of restaurant or cafe you were in</strong></em><br><em><strong>- why you were there</strong></em><br><em><strong>- and why you thought the service was good</strong></em></p>
<p>Here's my sample answer with the theme vocabulary underlined:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m going to talk about the service we received in a restaurant where a friend of mine celebrated his birthday last Saturday evening.</li>
<li>My friend had decided to book a table in a local Italian restaurant for the party. It was a small, family-run place, but this made it feel all the more <span style="text-decoration: underline;">welcoming</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">inviting</span>. The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">atmosphere was great</span> and the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">service was excellent</span>.</li>
<li>As I mentioned, I went to the restaurant because a friend had invited me to celebrate his birthday there. There were about ten of us there - mostly people I’ve known since university - and it was really nice to catch up with them and chat about what we had all been up to since we last got together.</li>
<li>The service was good because the restaurant staff and owners really <span style="text-decoration: underline;">made us feel at home</span>. From the moment we walked in, the waiters were <span style="text-decoration: underline;">polite</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">approachable</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">attentive</span>; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nothing was too much to ask</span>. They brought out a cake with candles and sang ‘Happy Birthday’ to my friend, although we hadn’t asked them to do this, and the restaurant owners kept checking whether we were happy with everything, which was <span style="text-decoration: underline;">thoughtful</span> of them. All in all, the delicious food, good company and friendly service made it <span style="text-decoration: underline;">an unforgettable evening</span>.</li>

				<p><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(mindset = established set of attitudes or way of thinking)</span></p>
<p>It seems to me that too many students have a <em><strong>"grammar mindset"</strong></em>. They believe that 'complex structures' are the key to a high IELTS score, and they focus on learning grammar rules and linking phrases.</p>
<p>I prefer the<strong> <em>"vocabulary mindset"</em></strong>. Students who have this mindset are more concerned about how native speakers <span style="text-decoration: underline;">really</span> use the language. They 'collect' words, phrases and collocations by doing lots of reading and listening, and they enjoy using the new vocabulary that they have 'copied' from these sources.</p>
<p>To me, the vocabulary mindset seems much more positive and proactive than the grammar mindset. It seems less critical and more curious, and I also think that it makes language learning more fun!</p>

	<p>
				<p>One of the suggestions that I make in my <a href="http://subscriptions.viddler.com/SimonCorcoran">video lessons</a> is that you prepare "theme" vocabulary for IELTS speaking part 2. Let's look at a theme that could help us with the task below.</p>
<p><em><strong>Describe a time when you received good service in a restaurant or cafe.</strong></em><br><em><strong>You should say</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>- when this was</strong></em><br><em><strong>- what kind of restaurant or cafe you were in</strong></em><br><em><strong>- why you were there</strong></em><br><em><strong>- and why you thought the service was good</strong></em></p>
<p>We could use the "friendly" theme from speaking lesson 4 in my video course. Here's the vocabulary that I suggested for that theme:</p>
<p><strong>"Friendly" theme (e.g. staff in a restaurant)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>welcoming, inviting</li>
<li>warm, approachable</li>
<li>polite, thoughtful, attentive</li>
<li>great atmosphere</li>
<li>make you feel at home</li>
<li>the service was excellent</li>
<li>nothing was too much to ask</li>
<li>an unforgettable evening</li>
</ul>
<p>Can you write a description that includes all of the words and phrases above?</p>

	<p>
				<p>In this lesson I'll try to answer Kami's question (see yesterday's lesson). Let's start by looking at the sentence below in more detail.</p>
<p><em>Fierce debates have been provoked if assignments ought to be done by students.</em></p>
<p><strong>Grammar</strong><br>There's really only one grammar mistake in the sentence above: the word "if" is used wrongly. We would need to write something like this: "Fierce debates have been provoked <strong><em>about the issue of whether</em></strong> assignments..."</p>
<p><strong>Vocabulary</strong><br>However, vocabulary is the real problem in the sentence:</p>
<ol>
<li>The word <strong><em>fierce</em></strong> is much too strong, and seems unnatural or inappropriate in this context. Are people really having fierce (i.e. furious, very angry) debates about homework?</li>
<li>I would also question the use of the word <strong><em>debates</em></strong>. Are people really debating this homework issue? Maybe they are, but this still seems a little exaggerated to me.</li>
<li>Next, while it isn't grammatically wrong, I would question the use of the word <em><strong>provoked</strong></em>. Has someone or something provoked this debate?</li>
<li>Finally, <em><strong>assignments</strong></em> are not necessarily the same thing as homework. Assignments can be done in the classroom, so the use of this word confuses the issue.</li>
</ol>
<p>While the grammar of the original sentence was <em>almost</em> correct, any native English speaker would find the sentence strange or unnatural, due to the vocabulary issues mentioned above. There's nothing "advanced or complex" about choosing inappropriate or exaggerated words that no English speaker would use.</p>
<p><strong>Final tip:</strong><br>It's good to be fascinated by new words and phrases, but using them correctly and appropriately is a different challenge. For most people, trying to write like an English-speaking journalist or novelist is like trying to play football at the level of Messi or Ronaldo! If you aim for such a high level, you're likely to make big mistakes.</p>

<p>I think robots are a clever idea. I'd love to have a robot that could speak to me and do things for me!</p>

<p>Yes, definitely. It would be great to have a robot helper at home, and I like the idea of driverless cars - I think driving would be safer if cars were controlled by robots.</p>

<p>No. I tend to buy average-priced shoes because I'm more interested in comfort than expensive brands.</p>
<p><em><strong>2. When you buy shoes, do you prefer convenience or style?</strong></em></p>
<p>I mainly look for comfort and convenience. But obviously I consider the style too, because I do choose shoes that match the clothes I wear.</p>
<p><em><strong>3. Why do you think some people buy many pairs of shoes?</strong></em></p>
<p>I suppose they either like following the latest fashions, or they want a pair of shoes to match all of the different clothes or outfits that they have.</p>
<p><em><strong>4. Have you ever bought shoes online?</strong></em></p>
<p>No, I haven't. I always like to try shoes on before I buy them, to make sure that they fit properly and feel comfortable.</p>

	<h4><a href="https://www.ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2017/05/ielts-grammar-vocabulary-fixed-phrases.html">IELTS Grammar / Vocabulary: 'fixed phrases'</a></h4>
	<p>
				<p>Sometimes it's better <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> to look at word usage from a grammar perspective. Instead, we can accept that some phrases are 'fixed', and there's no point worrying about the individual words within them.</p>
<p>The phrase <em><strong>"I look forward to seeing you"</strong></em>, from yesterday's lesson, is a good example. There's no point trying to understand why we use "to + ing" in this phrase. Just learn it as a fixed phrase.</p>
<p>Let's take another example. Someone asked me for a grammatical explanation of my use of the word "for" in the sentence below:</p>
<p><em>One option would be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">for</span> police officers to visit schools.</em> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(taken from <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2015/09/ielts-writing-task-2-strong-opinion-essay.html">this essay</a>)</span></p>
<p>Here's the answer that I gave the student:</p>
<p>It might be best to learn the whole phrase "one option would be for x to..." without trying to understand it word by word. You could consider this to be a 'fixed phrase'.</p>
<p>In other words, rather than looking at this from a grammar perspective, you could learn it as a vocabulary item. Then, the best way to understand the phrase is to see it used in various different contexts. Here are some examples from a Google search:</p>
<ul>
<li>One option would be for national authorities to intervene.</li>
<li>In order to improve the economy, one option would be for the government to invest in infrastructure.</li>
<li>One option would be for staff to work more hours.</li>
</ul>

	<p>
				<p>Many students have learnt that 'to' can't be followed by a word ending in 'ing'. But you might have noticed that I break this 'rule' in some of my essays. For example:</p>
<p>"strict punishments for driving offences are <strong>the key <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to</span> reduc<span style="text-decoration: underline;">ing</span></strong> traffic accidents"</p>
<p>This phrase is completely correct, so it must mean that the "rule" was wrong! You <span style="text-decoration: underline;">can</span> put 'to' with 'ing' in many situations. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>The key to being more productive is...</li>
<li>I look forward to seeing you.</li>
<li>He admitted to taking the money.</li>
<li>Scientists are closer to being able to...</li>
<li>Seven steps to reaching your goals!</li>
</ul>
<p>Can you find any more examples?<br>Tip: try searching on Google for "to being", "to having", "to doing" etc.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Example question</span><br>Do you think the seasons still influence people's behaviour?</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Example answer</span><br><em><strong>(direct answer)</strong></em> Yes, I do think the seasons still affect how we behave. <em><strong>(explain how)</strong></em> We still wear different clothes depending on the weather, and clothes shops change what they sell according to the season. We also adapt our habits and daily routines according to the time of year. <em><strong>(example)</strong></em> For example, people in my country like to eat outside in their gardens in the summer, but we can't do that during the other seasons. <em><strong>(opposite)</strong></em> On the other hand, I don't think we notice the change in seasons when it comes to food; the big supermarkets import food from around the world, so most people don't buy seasonal fruit and vegetables any more.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Last week I asked you about the difference between the following tasks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Describe an experience or situation that made you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">happy</span>.</li>
<li>Describe an experience or situation that made you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">laugh</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first task is easy because you can describe any positive situation or experience e.g. passing an exam, a special occasion, some good news, or even a time when someone told you a joke or a funny story.</p>
<p>The second task is a bit more specific. If you describe a positive experience like passing an exam, the examiner might not be convinced that you've understood the question properly. Did you really laugh when you passed the exam? Was it funny? I think the examiner would be expecting you to describe a funny situation like I did in <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2013/04/ielts-speaking-part-2-funny-situation.html">this lesson</a>.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Yesterday I showed you a 'bad' conclusion template, but what does a 'good' template look like?</p>
<p>One way for me to answer this is to recommend that you forget about templates completely. Just use the shortest, most basic 'organising' phrases, like "In conclusion", and focus on answering the question. In other words, you should worry about 'topic language', not 'template language'.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you really want a template for conclusions, have a look at <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2011/11/ielts-writing-task-2-conclusions.html">this lesson</a>. The templates you'll see there are acceptable.</p>

<p>My advice is simple: <strong>throw this template away!</strong> First, it contains mistakes. Second, it doesn't really make sense. And third, it's an example of the kind of "memorised language" that I wrote about in last Sunday's <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2017/04/ielts-advice-memorised-language.html">lesson</a>.

	<p>
				<p>What do examiners consider to be "memorised language", and how will your score be affected if you use it?</p>
<p><strong>Words</strong><br>Individual words will not be considered memorised. However, if you have learnt some "big" words, you should make sure that you can use them in a natural and appropriate way, because incorrect use of words will affect your vocabulary score.</p>
<p><strong>Phrases</strong><br>It's fine to memorise and use "<a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2015/02/ielts-advice-collocations-and-topic-vocabulary.html">topic vocabulary</a>" phrases (e.g.&nbsp;<em>the opportunity to engage face-to-face</em>) and short organising phrases (e.g. <em>people have different views about</em>...). However, I recommend that you avoid learning <strong><em>long</em></strong> "<a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2016/10/ielts-advice-phrases-for-any-essay.html">any essay</a>" phrases (e.g. ... <em>is a controversial and hotly debated issue in today's world</em>). These "phrases for any essay" are very obvious to the examiner, and you'll probably get a lower score if you use them.</p>
<p><strong>Sentences</strong><br>Again, "topic vocabulary" is fine, but "any essay" sentences are not. So, if the question is about environmental problems, you can use a full sentence from my blog (e.g. <em>Human activity is a major factor in the rise of the greenhouse gases that cause global warming</em>). Having said that, it isn't easy to memorise full sentences for a wide range of topics, so I advise people to learn shorter "topic" phrases instead.</p>
<p><strong>Paragraphs and full essays</strong><br>If you write a perfect paragraph or full essay from memory and it fits the question, the examiner will not know and you will not be penalised. However, you would need to memorise hundreds of essays, so I don't recommend that you take this approach! Furthermore, if you write a perfect essay but it doesn't match the question, you will score zero!</p>
<p><strong>My final tip</strong><br>I recommend that you learn words and phrases (and maybe a few full sentences) for common IELTS topics, as well as some simple words and phrases for linking and organising your ideas. <strong><em>Don't</em></strong> learn lists of "phrases for any essay".</p>

	<p>
				<p>If you use words, phrases or sentences from this website or from my ebook, will the examiner know that you have copied me, and therefore consider part of your answer to be memorised?</p>
<p>The answer is <strong>no</strong>! You can, and you should, use the language that you find on this site. If you can't use the language that a teacher gives you, how are you expected to learn English?</p>
<p>For example, look at the following sentence from my most recent essay:</p>
<p><em>"Students may not have the opportunity to engage face-to-face with their teachers."</em></p>
<p>It would be fine to use a word (e.g. engage) or a phrase (e.g. the opportunity to engage face-to-face) from this sentence. You can even use the whole sentence, as long as it's relevant to the question that you have been asked.</p>
<p>So what do examiners consider to be "memorised language"? I'll explain that in tomorrow's lesson.</p>

<p><em><strong>1) Do you like holidays? Why / why not?</strong></em></p>
<p>Yes, I love holidays because I get the chance to take a break from work, to relax and unwind, and to spend time with my family.</p>
<p><em><strong>2) Do you prefer to travel or stay at home during holiday periods? Why?</strong></em></p>
<p>If I can I prefer to travel. It's nice to get away from everything and to have a change of scenery. Also, I like visiting new places and doing some sightseeing.</p>
<p><em><strong>3) What do most people do during their holidays in your country? Why?</strong></em></p>
<p>During the summer especially, I think most British people go somewhere hot and sunny, to escape from the British weather!</p>
<p><em><strong>4) When do you prefer to take your holidays? Why?</strong></em></p>
<p>I like taking my holidays just outside the main summer season, which is July and August. If you go on holiday in May, June or September, everything is cheaper and places aren't so crowded with tourists.</p>

	<p>
				<p><em><strong>Describe a café that you have been to.</strong></em><br><em><strong>You should say</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>- where it is</strong></em><br><em><strong>- why you went there</strong></em><br><em><strong>- what you ate or drank</strong></em><br><em><strong>- and explain why you liked or disliked the café.</strong></em></p>
<p>Here's my sample band 9 answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m going to describe a café that I go to maybe once a week. It’s just down the road from where I live, near Manchester, so it’s really convenient for me to walk down there for a coffee or a bite to eat, and to use the wifi.</li>
<li>The last time I went to this local café was on Friday afternoon. I was trying to do some work at home, but I found myself getting distracted by little jobs around the house. So I decided to have a change of scenery; I put my laptop in its bag and made the short walk to the café, where I spent the next few hours getting all of my work done. With a nice cup of coffee and just the right level of background noise, I found it much easier to concentrate.</li>
<li>Over the course of the afternoon, I drank two cups of coffee and a glass or two of water. The café owner takes a lot of pride in making the best ‘flat white’ coffee in the area, so that’s what I tend to drink. If I remember correctly, the second coffee that I ordered was a decaf, because I try to avoid drinking too much caffeine in the afternoon. I didn’t have anything to eat on that occasion, but I do sometimes have one of the home-made cakes that they sell.</li>
<li>There are a few reasons why I like going to my local café. I suppose the main reasons are the coffee, the free wifi and the friendly staff. However, on Friday I also managed to sit at my favourite table near one of the windows, and the café wasn’t very busy. So the atmosphere and noise level were just right, and I was able to focus on my work without distractions for most of the afternoon.</li>

<p>Before I finish with the "slow" theme, I'd like to recommend that you put the words "slow practice" into Google (or another search engine). You'll find lots of interesting articles about the importance of slow practice in music, sport, martial arts and other areas of life. Why not use the same concept as one of your language learning tools?</p>

	<p>
				<p>I've written about this many times before, but I still hear from many people who think that the way to get a higher score is by using big, difficult or 'original' words.</p>
<p>For example, a student commented recently that she had improved her English by learning the words <em>ameliorate</em>, <em>juggernaut</em> and <em>katzenjammer</em>. I can honestly say that I had never seen or heard the word 'katzenjammer' before. My dictionary says that it is an informal and old-fashioned word that was used in the US, which explains why I didn't know it. If you use a word like that in your IELTS essay, your writing will look very strange!</p>
<p>Please don't waste your time learning strange words. Instead, read through the writing lessons on this website, and try to copy the writing style that I use.</p>

				<p>Here are some questions from Cambridge IELTS 11. Each of my answers contains three sentences and follows the method suggested in <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2015/03/ielts-speaking-part-3-long-answer-technique.html">this lesson</a>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Are the any occasions when reading at speed is a useful skill?</strong></em></p>
<p>Personally, if I’m reading something interesting, I don’t like reading too quickly because I feel that I don’t properly absorb the information. However, it can be useful to skim through things when you don’t really want to read them, or when you just need to find one particular piece of information. For example, I read at speed when I'm checking a household bill or a letter from the bank.</p>
<p><em><strong>Are there any jobs where people need to read a lot? What are they?</strong></em></p>
<p>Well, researchers obviously need to read a lot, and I suppose that politicians, journalists and other professionals who need to know about current affairs read a lot too. Having said that, I think most workers read hundreds of emails every week. In my previous job, for example, I had to check internal staff emails at least twice a day.</p>
<p><em><strong>Do you think that reading novels is more interesting than reading factual books? Why is that?</strong></em></p>
<p>Both types of book can be equally interesting in my opinion. A good novel can transport you to another world where the characters in the book become almost real. On the other hand, factual books can give you fascinating insights into anything from psychology to ancient history.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Some IELTS students spend a lot of time preparing "difficult" sentence structures to impress the examiner. One particular issue that people ask me about is the use of 'compound' and 'complex' sentences.</p>
<p>The first thing I would say about compound and complex sentences is that they are not "difficult". Here in the UK, children learn about these sentence structures in primary school (<a href="http://www.theschoolrun.com/what-are-simple-compound-and-complex-sentences-0">click here</a> to see how children are taught to understand sentence types). If you use words like <em><strong>and, but, because, although, while, when</strong></em> to connect ideas, you will automatically write a longer sentence that will be either compound or complex.</p>
<p>The second thing I would say is that you should not be worrying about these things when you are writing an IELTS essay. Just focus on answering the question and explaining your ideas well. I'm sure you'll naturally use "connecting" words to join ideas and create some longer sentences, so there's no need to worry about this at all.</p>

	<p>
				<p>The word "culture" is tricky because it can be used as an uncountable or a countable noun. It also has various meanings. A better understanding of this word will help you with the <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2017/02/ielts-writing-task-2-three-possible-introductions.html">writing task</a> that we've been working on, so let's look at some definitions and uses.</p>
<p><strong>1. Culture (uncountable): don't use with "a", don't make it plural<br></strong></p>
<p>This means the customs, beliefs, way of life, art, music, literature or social organisation of a group of people.</p>
<p>For example:<br>- I'm studying European culture. (everything from beliefs to art)<br>- This city is full of culture and history. (art, old buildings, traditional food etc.)</p>
<p><strong>2. Culture (countable): a culture / different cultures</strong></p>
<p>When we make 'culture' countable, we are <em><strong>usually*</strong></em> talking about the group of people itself. So, 'a culture' can be similar to 'a society' or 'a community'.</p>
<p>For example:<br>- Children are taught to respect different cultures. (different groups of people)<br>- Traditional cultures are disappearing. (traditional societies or communities)</p>
<p><strong>*Note:</strong><br>You might also see "a culture" used to describe an "attitude" e.g. The manager is trying to create a culture of success.</p>

	<p>
				<p>In the speaking test, you can use conversational (less formal) phrases that you wouldn't use in the writing test. Here are some examples from yesterday's lesson:</p>
<ul>
<li>leave something until the last minute</li>
<li>work flat out (meaning: work hard without stopping)</li>
<li>get something finished</li>
<li>get something done</li>
<li>one in particular that I really struggled with</li>
<li>put something off (meaning: avoid doing it)</li>
<li>in the end</li>
<li>have mixed feelings about</li>
<li>get started on something</li>
<li>to go through it again (meaning: to do or experience something again)</li>
</ul>
<p>I also used some good words and phrases that would be suitable for both speaking and writing (i.e. this vocabulary is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> informal):</p>
<ul>
<li>procrastinating</li>
<li>producing a final draft</li>
<li>complete the final draft</li>
<li>the pressure of such a close deadline</li>
<li>manage the task in an efficient way</li>
<li>I limited myself to just ten research sources</li>
<li>summarise and synthesise</li>
<li>I was relieved and quite impressed with myself</li>
</ul>
<p>The vocabulary in the two lists above might not seem 'difficult', but it's the kind of natural "native-speaker" language that will impress the examiner. That's why I gave the answer a band 9.</p>

	<p>
				<p><em><strong>Describe a time when you were really busy. You should say</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>- when this was</strong></em><br><em><strong>- why you were so busy</strong></em><br><em><strong>- how you managed the situation</strong></em><br><em><strong>- and explain how you felt at the time.</strong></em></p>
<p>Here's my full band 9 answer to this question:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m going to talk about the time I left a university assignment until the last minute and had to work flat out to get it finished. This was about ten years ago when I was doing my Master’s degree.</li>
<li>I had to do several 3000-word assignments for the modules on my Master’s course, but I remember that there was one in particular that I really struggled with. I had been procrastinating and putting it off for weeks, and in the end I left myself just two days to get the whole assignment done. This included finding and reading relevant books and articles, deciding on my thesis and assignment title, and producing a final draft which had to be handed in to the department office before the deadline.</li>
<li>The pressure of such a close deadline actually forced me to manage the task in a really efficient way. My first step was to decide on the general area that I wanted to write about, and then I limited myself to just ten research sources. I printed the most relevant pages, highlighted the key paragraphs and made some notes to summarise and synthesise the ideas that I found interesting. Finally, I just started writing the main body of the assignment, and I wrote the title and the introduction last.</li>
<li>I had mixed feelings at the time. I was annoyed with myself for leaving it so late to get started on the assignment, but I was relieved and quite impressed with myself when I managed to complete the final draft so quickly. It was also quite stressful and tiring to have to find articles, do photocopying and then write everything so quickly. I wouldn’t want to go through that again!</li>

	<p>
				<p>A student wrote to me with a useful question:</p>
<p><em>"My IELTS teacher told us not to mention complex subjects and show off knowledge in the speaking test. I tend to talk about my major using big words and terms to expand my answers. Would this be seen as "showing off knowledge"? And what do you think about this advice?"</em></p>
<p>To answer this question, let's compare two answers to the question "how often do you eat chocolate?":</p>
<p><strong>Answer 1:</strong><br>I probably eat something that contains chocolate, like a chocolate bar or a cake, every couple of days.</p>
<p><strong>Answer 2:</strong><br>I try to keep my chocolate intake to a minimum because it is relatively high in calories, and because sugary foods can lead to insulin resistance.</p>
<p>The second answer might look more difficult and impressive, but it actually seems inappropriate and unnatural. I much prefer the first answer. So, I think this is what the teacher meant when he/she advised students not to "show off their knowledge", and I agree with this advice.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here are my sample answers for the 'chocolate' topic. Remember that your priority in speaking part 1 is to demonstrate fluency by giving answers that are short, direct and natural, without hesitating too much.</p>
<p><em><strong>1) Do you like chocolate? Why / why not?</strong></em></p>
<p>Yes, I love chocolate. I like the taste, the texture and the feeling that you get when you eat it. And it goes really well with my favourite drink, coffee.</p>
<p><em><strong>2) What type of chocolate do you prefer? Why?</strong></em></p>
<p>I prefer dark chocolate to milk chocolate, because it has a stronger taste. I also like chocolate when it's in a cake, and I love drinking hot chocolate too.</p>
<p><em><strong>3) When do you usually eat chocolate?</strong></em></p>
<p>I try not to eat too much, but I probably eat or drink something that contains chocolate every couple of days.</p>
<p><em><strong>4) Do people give chocolate as a present in your country? When?</strong></em></p>
<p>Yes, it's very common to give boxes of individual chocolates as a gift. You can give chocolates on any special occasion really: birthdays, Valentine's day, Easter, Christmas, and so on.</p>

				<p>Here are my answers to questions 2 and 3 from last week's lesson:</p>
<p><em><strong>2) Do you think it's better to rent or to buy a place to live in?</strong></em></p>
<p>I think it’s better to buy your own home if you can afford to do that. Buying your own home is a better investment in the long term, because you can sell the home and perhaps even make a profit on it. The alternative is to pay rent to a landlord who can ask you to leave at any moment.</p>
<p><em><strong>3) Do you agree that there is a right age for young adults to stop living with their parents?</strong></em></p>
<p>I’m not sure what the ‘right’ age would be, but I do agree with the principle that young adults should try to live alone if they can. For some people, the right age is when they get their first full-time jobs and can afford to pay rent, and for others it's when they start university and move into a hall of residence with other students. This was what happened in my case; I moved out of the family home at age 18 when I started university.</p>
<p><strong>Let's look at how I structured the above answers.</strong></p>

	<p>
				<p>A student asked me: Can I use the words <em>pros and cons, leaps and bounds, merits and demerits</em>?</p>
<p><strong>Here's my simple answer:</strong></p>
<p>No. I don't recommend using any of those words in your IELTS test. I never use them, so why would you use them? By the way, if you want to check whether I use a word, <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2016/07/ielts-advice-search-this-website.html">click here</a> and follow the advice about how to search my website.</p>
<p><strong>Here's a longer answer:</strong></p>
<p>Why are you asking about those words? If you are studying vocabulary, you should be focusing on <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2011/12/ielts-vocabulary-topic-specific-vocabulary.html">'topic-specific' vocabulary</a>, not 'generic' language (words and phrases that can be used in any essay). Linking words and other generic words or phrases might be necessary in terms of essay structure, but they don't help your vocabulary score. That's why, for linking and organisation, I prefer to use 'normal' vocabulary like firstly, secondly, finally, however, on the one hand, on the other hand, furthermore, advantages, disadvantages, benefits, positives etc. There is no need to find less common alternatives for these words and phrases.</p>
<p><strong>Finally, a quick explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>"pros and cons" is a bit too informal for IELTS writing.</li>
<li>"leaps and bounds" is an informal phrase that we use to talk about improvements e.g. "Since living in the UK, my English has come on in leaps and bounds" (meaning: my English has improved a lot). You might be able to use this in the speaking test, but don't use it in an essay.</li>
<li>"merits and demerits" is not a good alternative for "advantages and disadvantages". I've never used the word "demerits" in my life.</li>
</ul>

	<p>
				<p>Read my full answer to the 'proud' task below. If you have time, note down the good words and phrases that you find.</p>
<p><em><strong>Describe something you did that made you feel proud of yourself.</strong></em><br><em><strong>You should say</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>- what you did</strong></em><br><em><strong>- when you did it</strong></em><br><em><strong>- why you felt proud of what you had done</strong></em><br><em><strong>- and explain how you felt when this happened.</strong></em></p>
<p>One of my proudest achievements was completing my undergraduate degree at the university of ….. (name). The key moment that I remember was when I received my final exam results; I was delighted to have passed with better scores than I expected.</p>
<p>I graduated from university in …… (year). As far as I recall, we received our final exam results in May and the graduation ceremony was in July. Our exam scores for individual course modules were posted on the noticeboard in the corridor of the university department, and I remember getting into the lift in the department one morning, knowing that I would soon see my results.</p>
<p>The particular moment when I really felt overjoyed and proud of what I had achieved was when I saw my exam results on the department noticeboard. This was the precise point in time when I realised that I had passed and that my hard work had paid off. I was proud because I had overcome some setbacks earlier in the course, and I had proved to myself that I could achieve my goals.</p>
<p>As I approached the department noticeboard I felt really nervous but also excited; I knew that the moment of truth was just seconds away. And when I saw my final exam results I was surprised, thrilled and relieved all at the same time. I didn’t shout out with joy, but I think I probably clenched my fist and said “yes” to myself. I certainly remember walking back down the corridor with a spring in my step, feeling elated and knowing that four years of study were finally over.</p>

<p>It's true that, as a native English speaker, if I brainstorm for long enough I can probably find all of the ideas that I need in my head. However, I can make the task so much easier and quicker by using a dictionary, thesaurus, collocations dictionary and the Internet.</p>

	<p>
				<p>If you're preparing ideas for a question or topic area for part 2 of the speaking test, I recommend starting with one or two key words or ideas. In my video lessons I call these key ideas "themes".</p>
<p>When you have a theme, you can then search for good vocabulary related to that theme. Here are two resources that will help you:</p>
<ol>
<li>A <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>thesaurus</strong></span> will give you synonyms and similar words. I use the thesaurus on my computer, but you'll easily find one online if your computer doesn't have a built-in dictionary.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://oxforddictionary.so8848.com">Oxford Collocation Dictionary</a> will show you words that are often used together with your chosen word; so you'll be be able to use your words correctly in longer phrases.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's use the 'proud' topic in <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2016/11/ielts-speaking-part-2-proud-topic.html">this lesson</a> as an example.</p>
<p>First, I'll choose two "theme" words: <em><strong>proud</strong></em> and <strong><em>achievement</em></strong>.</p>
<p>From my <span style="text-decoration: underline;">thesaurus</span>, here are some other words to describe being 'proud':</p>
<p>- pleased<br>- glad<br>- delighted<br>- overjoyed<br>- thrilled</p>
<p>And from the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">collocation dictionary</span>, some phrases with the word 'achievement':</p>
<p>- a great / major / outstanding / remarkable / tremendous achievement<br>- my proudest achievement<br>- a feeling of achievement<br>- a sense of achievement</p>
<p>This is just the beginning of my 'theme preparation', but I'm already starting to gather some nice vocabulary for my description. In next Friday's lesson, I'll show you how I include these ideas in a full answer.</p>

	<p>
				<p>IELTS candidates often use good collocations or phrases, but they get them slightly wrong. This is what happened in the sentences in yesterday's lesson:</p>
<p>1) Use "be + achievement". You can't use "win + achievement"<br>Example: It was a great achievement. Don't say: I won a great achievement.</p>
<p>2) "my hard work (had) paid off"<br>Example: I was proud that all of my hard work had paid off.<br>The mistake in yesterday's lesson was to make this passive (had been paid off).</p>
<p>3) "I'll never forget" and "I never forget" have different meanings<br>- I'll never forget the day when I passed the exam. (a memorable event)<br>- I never forget my mother's birthday. (you remember every year)</p>
<p>4) "lose interest in something". Never write the plural "interests"<br>Example: I lost interest in the course.</p>
<p>5) With the word "difficulty / difficulties" you can use these verbs:<br>have, face, experience, encounter, run into, get into<br>You can't say "difficulties concurred".</p>
<p>6) "due to" is followed by a noun, not a subject + verb<br>Example: due to the fact that I had never...<br>Don't say: due to I had never...</p>

<p>To be honest, I'm not sure how they chose it; I've never asked them. I suppose it was just a name that they both liked, and maybe they thought it suited me.</p>
<p><em><strong>2) Does your name have any special meaning?</strong></em></p>
<p>It might do, but I don't know what that meaning is; I've never looked it up. Maybe I'll google it later today; you've made me curious to find out!</p>
<p><em><strong>3) Is your name common or unusual in your country?</strong></em></p>
<p>Yes, it's quite a common name. I remember that there were two other people with the same name as me in my class at school.</p>

<p><em><strong>- what the item of clothing is</strong></em><br><em><strong>- where and when you bought it</strong></em><br><em><strong>- when you wear it</strong></em><br><em><strong>- and explain why you like wearing it.</strong></em></p>
<p>Here's my sample answer, using the vocabulary from last week's <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2016/10/ielts-speaking-part-2-prepare-a-theme.html">lesson</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m going to describe a coat that I often wear at the moment. The coat is dark blue in colour, and it’s made out of a lightweight, waterproof material, which makes it perfect for wearing at this time of year here in the UK. It also has a detachable hood, which I used yesterday when it was raining, and various pockets on the outside and on the inside.</li>
<li>I bought the coat last year at the beginning of autumn when the weather started to get colder. It was easy to buy because I had had the exact same coat before; my old coat was starting to look a bit worn out, so I decided to buy a new version. As I knew which size I needed, I simply went online and found the best offer; I bought it through a shopping website, and it was delivered to my house a few days later.</li>
<li>As I said, I’m wearing this coat a lot at the moment. It’s my everyday coat for going to work or for when I go out shopping or for any other reason.</li>
<li>The reason why I like this coat is that it’s so practical and functional. It’s waterproof and it keeps me warm, but it also comes in handy for carrying things like my phone, wallet, loose change, a pen, and even a notebook; I tend to fill my pockets with whatever I can. It even folds up small enough to fit in my bag when I don’t need it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: I missed out the words 'multipurpose' and 'hard-wearing material'. Can you suggest how we could add these words to the description?</p>

You should say</em></strong><br><strong><em>- what the item of clothing is</em></strong><br><strong><em>- where and when you bought it</em></strong><br><strong><em>- when you wear it</em></strong><br><strong><em>- and explain why you like wearing it.</em></strong></p>
<p>The first idea that came into my head was to describe my coat. And the first idea that I had about this coat was to say that it is useful or practical. So my 'theme' is useful / practical, and I've brainstormed other words and phrases related to this theme.</p>
<p><strong>Ideas related to the theme of a useful / practical coat:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>functional</li>
<li>multipurpose</li>
<li>hard-wearing material</li>
<li>lightweight material</li>
<li>various pockets</li>
<li>a detachable hood</li>
<li>waterproof</li>
<li>it keeps me warm</li>
<li>it comes in handy when…</li>
<li>it’s perfect for carrying my…</li>
<li>it folds up small enough to fit into my bag</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe you could brainstorm ideas in the same way, using the theme of a <em><strong>comfortable</strong></em> or <em><strong>stylish</strong></em> piece of clothing.</p>

<p>1) Are clothes and clothing fashions important to you?<br>2) What different clothes do you wear for different situations?<br>3) Do you wear different styles of clothes now compared to 10 years ago?<br>4) Do you think the clothes we wear say something about who we are?</p>
<p><strong>Part 2</strong></p>
<p>Describe a piece of clothing that you like wearing. You should say<br>- what the item of clothing is<br>- where and when you bought it<br>- when you wear it<br>- and explain why you like wearing it.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Following on from yesterday's advice about doing the easy things well, let's think about some of the 'easy' aspects of the IELTS test:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Speaking part 1:</strong> Have you mastered the art of giving short, simple answers without hesitation? Have a look at <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2016/07/ielts-speaking-part-1-simplify.html">this lesson</a> to see some useful examples.</li>
<li><strong>Listening section 1:</strong> Can you get 10 out of 10 correct answers? If you can't, you need to do more work on this section before you worry about sections 2, 3 and 4.</li>
<li><strong>Writing task 1 introductions:</strong> If you've done enough practice, you should find it easy to write task 1 introductions. Use the method in <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2010/08/ielts-writing-task-1-how-to-write-an-introduction.html">this lesson</a>.</li>

	<p>
				<p>Here are some example answers for the questions that I shared last week. Remember to focus on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">fluency</span> in part 1. Try not to hesitate; just say the first thing that comes into your head.</p>
<p><em><strong>1) How much time do you spend at home?</strong></em></p>
<p>Obviously I sleep at home, but I don't spend very much time at home during the day, because I'm usually busy with work.</p>
<p><em><strong>2) Do you prefer to spend your free time at home or outside the house?</strong></em></p>
<p>During the day I prefer to be out of the house, so I like visiting family or meeting up with friends. But I do like relaxing at home in the evenings.</p>
<p><em><strong>3) What do you do when you have some free time and you're at home?</strong></em></p>
<p>I usually sit and watch some TV or a film, or I listen to some music. I also like sitting outside if the weather is nice.</p>
<p><em><strong>4) Would you like to have more spare time to spend at home in the future?</strong></em></p>
<p>No, not really. I get bored if I'm at home for too long. In the future, I imagine I'll still prefer to go out and do things rather than stay indoors.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Someone asked me about the following phrase, which describes a band 9 task response in writing task 2:</p>
<p><em>"presents a fully developed position with relevant, fully extended and well supported ideas"</em></p>
<p>Is it really possible to "fully extend and support" your ideas in such a short essay? Probably not. If you had time to write 1000 words, I'm sure you could extend and support your ideas more fully.</p>
<p>However, we shouldn't "overthink" this problem. Examiners know that it's impossible to write a truly perfect, fully developed answer in just 250 words. They understand the limitations of the task, and (hopefully!) they use their common sense. Instead of worrying about the precise meaning of the band descriptions, it's best to simply focus on answering the question as well as you can.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Occasionally I like to use this blog to share my thoughts about how to achieve goals. Here's a summary of what I believe are the keys to success in IELTS, or in any other endeavour:</p>
<p><strong>1) The best information</strong><br>If you want to achieve something, you first need to find the best source of information and guidance that you can.</p>
<p><strong>2) Persistent work</strong><br>Of course, you'll need to use the information that you have and take action. You'll need to do the regular practice that leads to improvement.</p>
<p><strong>3) Positive attitude</strong> (or <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2014/11/ielts-reading-multiple-choice.html">growth mindset</a>)<br>If you have the right guidance and you're working hard, you need to be positive and patient. Try not to waste time worrying; instead, trust the process and know that you will improve gradually. Don't expect fast or easy results.</p>
<p><strong>4) Measure your progress</strong><br>Finally, you need to find a way to analyse the work that you produce. This will allow you to learn from your mistakes and make any necessary changes to your approach. Also, tracking your progress will give you confidence that you are moving towards your goal.</p>

	<p>
				<p>The last bullet point on the task card for speaking part 2 usually asks you to describe your feelings. Often, this last point contains the word 'why' e.g. explain <em><strong>why</strong></em> you liked...</p>
<p>So, it's a good idea to prepare some good words and phrases that help you to express your feelings in a more interesting way. Instead of saying "it was nice", why not say "it was an unforgettable experience"?</p>
<p><strong>Study idea:</strong><br>Go back through my speaking lessons and search for full sample answers for part 2 (like the one I wrote <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2016/09/ielts-speaking-part-2-hurry-answer.html">last Friday</a>).

				<p>I used several phrasal verbs (e.g. pick up, look out for, turn off, carry on) in my description in yesterday's lesson.</p>
<p>These verbs look easy, but they are good examples of the kind of natural, idiomatic language that native speakers use. The tricky thing about phrasal verbs is that you have to learn what each one means; you can't understand them by translating the individual words.</p>
<p>For example, I used "pick up" to mean "collect" (I was waiting for my colleague to collect me), but "pick up" can also mean improve, learn quickly, or receive. Have a look at <a href="https://www.usingenglish.com/reference/phrasal-verbs/pick+up.html">this page</a> on a grammar website. Can you see why phrasal verbs might impress the examiner if you use them correctly?</p>

	<p>
				<p>Let's return to the 'hurry' question that I showed you a few weeks ago:</p>
<p><em><strong>Describe a time when you had to do something in a hurry.</strong></em><br><em><strong>You should say</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>- what you were doing</strong></em><br><em><strong>- when this was</strong></em><br><em><strong>- why you had to hurry</strong></em><br><em><strong>- and explain how you felt at that time</strong></em></p>
<p>Here's my sample answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m going to talk about a time when I had to hurry to get ready for a trip with some colleagues while I was working in a previous job.</li>
<li>It was a Monday morning about five years ago. A group of us had to catch an early flight, and a senior member of our department had volunteered to drive us to the airport. I was supposed to be ready and waiting to be picked up from my home at 5.30am, and my colleague had asked me to look out for his car so that he didn’t have to ring my doorbell.</li>
<li>The problem was that I overslept. I had set my alarm, but somehow I must have turned it off and carried on sleeping. Suddenly, at 5.30am, my doorbell rang and I looked over at my alarm clock. I immediately realised what had happened, and I sprang out of bed and got dressed in record time. I splashed some water on my face, quickly brushed my teeth, and put my shoes on without properly tying the laces. Then I picked up my suitcase and coat, and left the house.</li>
<li>I can still remember the moment when the doorbell woke me up and I saw the time: I was filled with a sense of panic and fear as I realised that my colleagues were waiting outside. Then, when I left my house and walked towards the awaiting car, I felt so embarrassed because it was obvious that I hadn’t been ready on time.</li>

<p>There are no guarantees when you ask for a re-mark. However, if you think you did well in the <em><strong>writing</strong></em> test, if you got higher scores in the other three parts, and if you missed your target by only half a band, it might be worth a try.</p>

	<p>
				<p>A student called Sebastian asked me the following useful question:</p>
<p><em>In writing task 2, what if I choose a strong opinion answer (e.g. completely agree) but I only have one idea? In other words, I only have an idea for one main-body paragraph, so what can I write in the second body paragraph?</em></p>
<p>Here are my tips to address Sebastian's question:</p>
<ol>
<li>You could solve this problem during your planning time, before you start writing. If you realise that you only have one idea, you still have time to change to a 'balanced' opinion answer.</li>
<li>Alternatively, you could use the <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2010/10/ielts-writing-task-2-tourism.html">'perspectives'</a> approach to planning. This might help you to divide your main idea into two parts (e.g. the same idea from an individual perspective and from a social or economic perspective).</li>
<li>Another method that I use is to support my opinion in paragraph 2, and then refute the opposite opinion in paragraph 3. This is the essay structure that I suggested in Wednesday's <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2016/08/ielts-writing-task-2-introduction-and-plan.html">lesson</a>.

	<p>
				<p>Here's a useful question from a student called Tuan:<br>.....</p>
<p><em>In the book 'Complete IELTS', it says that in speaking part 3 the examinee should talk about the subject in general, not in a personal way.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Example question:</strong> How popular is art as a school subject?</em></p>
<p><em><strong>The book advises me to say this:</strong></em><br><em>On the whole, I think most children enjoy art, although they do seem to go off it a bit when they get older. I guess that's to be expected.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>The book says I shouldn't say this:</strong></em><br><em>Well, in my primary school, children loved it. I loved making things, for example, and in my secondary school, students hated it; we couldn't see the point when we had so many other things to do.</em></p>
<p><em>Simon, do you agree with this advice?<br></em>.....</p>
<p>Here's my reply:</p>
<p>The examiner just wants to hear a good answer. If the question is general rather than personal, like the example above, it makes sense to answer in a general way. It seems strange to go straight into a personal example about your own primary school.</p>
<p>However, there is nothing wrong with including a personal example <em><strong>after</strong></em> giving a general answer. I tell my students to follow three steps when answering part 3 speaking questions: first answer the question (in a general way), then explain your answer, then support your answer with an example (which could be a personal example).</p>

<li>Penalties for dangerous drivers can act as a deterrent, <em><strong>meaning that</strong></em> people avoid repeating the same offence.</li>
<li>Some bilinguals also have two cultural identities, <em><strong>meaning that</strong></em> they are able to adapt their behaviour effortlessly.</li>
<li>Some people call this ‘cultural imperialism’, <em><strong>meaning that</strong></em> one culture has power over others.</li>

	<p>
				<p>People are often surprised when I tell them to stop thinking about 'academic' language, complex grammar or 'difficult' words. In <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2016/05/ielts-writing-task-2-ignore-the-word-academic.html">this lesson</a>, for example, I suggest that IELTS writing task 2 is more like a high school essay than a university assignment.</p>
<p>Here's some feedback from a student in relation to this advice:</p>
<p><em>Hi Simon,</em></p>
<p><em>I was initially very sceptical of your "high school" writing approach. I believed in a complicated, "academic" style writing with flashy words and complex sentences. Well, I was wrong.</em></p>
<p><em>With that mindset, on the IELTS test day I confidently penned a monstrous 400-word essay with multiple metaphors, symbolism, lengthy sentences, and analyses of complex real-world examples. I ended up getting a band 7 for writing (L9, R9, S8.5).</em></p>
<p><em>I was very surprised. What I came to understand is that the IELTS encourages clear, concise and coherent writing more than anything else. It really is a high school writing task. If I ever take the IELTS test again, I will make absolutely sure to follow the simple and effective strategy that you advocate.</em></p>

				<p>Examiners often begin the speaking test by asking about your home. Here are some typical questions and sample answers.</p>
<p><em><strong>1) Do you live in a house or an apartment?</strong></em></p>
<p>I live in a semi-detached house with three bedrooms and a small garden.</p>
<p><em><strong>2) Which room do you like most in your house? Why?</strong></em></p>
<p>My favourite room is the kitchen because it looks out onto the back garden, and it's on the side of the house that catches the afternoon sun.</p>
<p><em><strong>3) Is there anything about your house that you would like to change?</strong></em></p>
<p>Well, it would be nice if it were a detached house so that we could have windows on the wall that we currently share with our neighbours.</p>
<p><em><strong>4) Tell me something else about your house.</strong></em></p>
<p>The previous owners converted the loft into an extra bedroom; that's the quietest room in the house, and the best place to go to do some work.</p>

<p><em>1) Do you think there are too many game shows on TV nowadays? Why?</em></p>
<p><strong>(answer)</strong> Yes, there are far too many game shows on TV for my liking. <strong>(explain)</strong> I suppose the channels show these programmes because they are popular, and they must be very profitable. <strong>(example)</strong> A good example is 'Who wants to be a millionaire?', which has been sold to TV channels across the world. <strong>(alternative)</strong> Personally, I'm not a fan of game shows, and I'd much rather watch a film or an original drama series.</p>
<p><em>2) Do you think that people pay attention to adverts on TV? Why?</em></p>
<p><strong>(answer)</strong> Yes, I think we are all influenced to some extent by TV adverts, otherwise companies wouldn't pay so much to have them shown. <strong>(explain)</strong> Advertisers are very good at making us believe that their products or services will improve our lives in some way. <strong>(example)</strong> For example, if you see an advert for a new phone, it plants a seed in your mind, and you start to wonder about upgrading your old phone.</p>

<p><em>I have a big problem with verb tenses, especially the present perfect continuous and past perfect continuous. I can't use these tenses when I'm speaking. How can I solve this problem?</em></p>
<p>My answer is simple: stop worrying about this! You don't have time to think about grammar when you're speaking.

	<p>
				<p>People often ask me whether it is necessary to talk about all of the points on the task card in speaking part 2.</p>
<p>The answer is no. You won't lose any marks for missing some of the bullet points on the task card. There's nothing in the examiner's marking scheme about covering every point.</p>
<p>However, I do still advise people to <em><strong>try</strong></em> to cover each point. Here's why:</p>
<ul>
<li>The points on the task card help you to structure your description.</li>
<li>They help you to move forward, rather than getting stuck on one idea.</li>
<li>The points are 'prompts' that remind you what to say next.</li>
<li>The final point is often a 'why' question, which will allow you to express your feelings, opinions and reasons using some good descriptive language. It would be a shame to miss this point.</li>

<p><em><strong>1) What type of photos do you like taking?</strong></em></p>
<p>Well, I don't usually take photos to be honest. I prefer to enjoy whatever I'm doing, rather than stop to take a photograph.</p>
<p><em><strong>2) What do you do with photos you take?</strong></em></p>
<p>I rarely take photos, but if I occasionally use my mobile phone to take a picture of something, I just leave the photo there; I don't do anything special with it.</p>
<p><em><strong>3) When you visit other places, do you take photos or buy postcards?</strong></em></p>
<p>I don't really do either. I leave it to my friends or other family members to take photographs; I'm usually with someone who likes taking photos and can share them with me later.</p>
<p><em><strong>4) Do you like people taking photos of you?</strong></em></p>
<p>No, I prefer not to be in photos. I always feel awkward when someone asks me to smile for the camera, and I don't think I'm very photogenic.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong><br>It's usually easier to give positive answers, but it's worth practising some negative responses just in case you get a topic that doesn't interest you. Whatever the question is, the easiest way to answer is to tell the truth!</p>

	<p>
				<p>Last week I did some IELTS teacher training at Liverpool University. Afterwards, I asked the teachers what they found most useful about the session, and three things stood out:</p>
<ol>
<li>They liked my advice on essay planning for writing task 2. In particular, they thought that numbering the ideas in the plan was really useful. Watch <a href="http://subscriptions.viddler.com/SimonCorcoran/fkvcqe">this video</a> to see an example.</li>
<li>They had a clearer understanding of the differences between IELTS writing and university academic writing e.g. using <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2012/01/ielts-writing-task-2-using-the-word-i.html">the word "I"</a>.</li>
<li>They liked the idea that <em><strong>it's easier to get faster than it is to get better</strong></em>. Don't worry if it takes you <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2011/08/ielts-advice-the-four-hour-essay.html">four hours</a> to write a band 7 essay; the important thing is that you're achieving that score.

				<p>In Wednesday's <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2016/05/ielts-writing-task-2-these-phrases-dont-impress.html">lesson</a> I showed you some examples of the kind of memorised phrases that examiners <strong><em>don't</em></strong> like. Here's the reply that I wrote to the student who asked me about those phrases:</p>
<p><em>Too many people write "empty" essays. Their essays are "packaged" with phrases like the ones you mentioned, but there is nothing inside the package - no real topic content.</em></p>
<p>If you read my own essays here on the blog, you'll see that the "packaging" is quite simple. I'm much more concerned about the <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2012/01/ielts-advice-real-content.html">contents</a>.</p>

	<p>
				<p>In case you missed the advice at the end of the <a href="http://subscriptions.viddler.com/SimonCorcoran/na7tye">video lesson</a> that I shared last week, here's my main tip for each of the 3 parts in the speaking test:</p>
<p><strong>Part 1</strong><br>Focus on <strong><span style="color: #007f40;">fluency</span></strong>. You don't need to show off with great vocabulary or grammar in this part. Just try to answer quickly, without hesitating. A short, simple answer is fine.</p>
<p><strong>Part 2</strong><br>Focus on <strong><span style="color: #007f40;">ideas / vocabulary</span></strong>. This is your best chance to impress the examiner with some nice language, especially if you've prepared for common topics in the way I suggest in my video lessons.</p>
<p><strong>Part 3</strong><br>Focus on your <span style="color: #007f40;"><strong>answer structure</strong></span>. Use the 3 or 4 steps that I explained in last week's video. This will force you to give longer answers without repeating yourself. You don't really have time to think about good vocabulary or grammar; just worry about answering the question by following the steps.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em><br>Notice that I don't recommend worrying about grammar or linking at any point in the speaking test. Finally, if you forget every other exam tip, just remember one thing: <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2016/05/ielts-advice-answer-the-question.html">answer the question</a>!</p>

	<p>
				<p>In the IELTS speaking and writing tests, the most important thing is to answer the question. This seems obvious, but many students are so worried about using 'difficult grammar' that they don't give <em><strong>relevant</strong></em> answers.</p>
<p>In the speaking test, listen carefully to the question and answer it as if you were speaking to a friend. Try to speak without thinking too much; forget the grammar and just have a normal conversation.</p>
<p>In the writing test, take some time to understand each question and plan your answer. Check the question every time you write a new idea; make sure that everything you write is <em><strong>relevant</strong></em>. If part of your answer is not related to the topic you will lose marks, even if your grammar is perfect.</p>

Take the following question, for example:</p>
<p><em><strong>Describe a beautiful sky that you watched</strong></em></p>
<p>I would adapt my description of London (main topic: describe a place). I already have some good ideas: the spectacular views, the skyline, the iconic buildings, the landmarks etc. I could simply add that I watched the sunset from a 'vantage point' overlooking the city centre. This question now seems a lot easier!</p>
<p>Have another look through the topics that people shared in the comments below last week's&nbsp;<a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2016/04/ielts-speaking-part-2-outside-the-main-topics.html">lesson</a>, and think about whether you could adapt your ideas from one of the six main topics.</p>

	<p>
				<p>In yesterday's lesson I asked why teachers often give students the wrong advice about IELTS writing. This can happen even with teachers who are generally very good at teaching English.</p>
<p>In my experience, the reason is simple:</p>
<p>Many teachers have been trained to teach<em><strong> academic writing for university</strong></em>, but they haven't had any specific <em><strong>IELTS training</strong></em>. IELTS writing follows a few different rules compared to university writing, and teachers aren't always aware of the differences. Maybe we need a list of these differences; can you think of any?</p>

	<p>
				<p>Recently I've made video lessons about the 6 main topic areas for IELTS speaking part 2:</p>

				<p>Instead of looking for a grammatical explanation for the use of a word or phrase, it's often better to search for real examples of usage.</p>

<p><em>Is there a difference between "in terms of" and "with regard to"? When and how should we use these phrases?</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Task:</strong></em><br>Can you find 3 examples of each of the two phrases in the student's question above? Use a search engine, such as Google, and choose examples that come from reliable sources (e.g. newspaper articles). Does this help you to see how and when the two phrases are used? Do you think there is a difference between them?</p>

	<p>
				<p>My main tip for speaking part 2 is to prepare good vocabulary for common topics. This is what I've done in each of my&nbsp;<a href="http://subscriptions.viddler.com/SimonCorcoran">video lessons</a> for this part of the test.</p>
<p>On the task card, the last bullet point always asks you to explain <em><strong>why</strong></em>. This is the best part of the question in terms of vocabulary preparation. Let's take the "describe a family" question as an example:</p>
<p><em>Describe a family (not your own family) that you like. You should say</em></p>
<p><em>- how you know this family</em><br><em>- who the people in the family are</em><br><em>- what the members of the family are like</em><br><em>- and explain <strong>WHY</strong> you like this family.</em></p>
<p>Here are some ideas for the "why" part of this task:</p>
<ul>
<li>friendly, kind, caring, big-hearted</li>
<li>supportive, always there when you need them</li>
<li>good role models, they set a good example</li>
<li>welcoming, great hosts, their door is always open</li>
</ul>
<p>Can you think of any more words or phrases to add to this list?</p>

	<p>
				<p>Students often don't notice when a teacher corrects their mistakes.</p>
<p>Look at this example of a conversation between a student and a teacher:</p>
<p>Student: <em>I gave the IELTS test five times.</em><br>Teacher: <em>Oh, you've taken the test five times?</em><br>Student: <em>Yes, the last time I gave it was two weeks ago.</em></p>
<p>The student doesn't notice that the teacher is correcting a mistake. In English we <em><strong>don't</strong></em> say "give a test" (unless you are the examiner giving the test to the students), we say "<em><strong>take</strong></em> a test".</p>
<p>When a teacher repeats something that you said in a different way, it's possible that you made a mistake. Listen carefully, and try to notice mistakes and corrections. If you're not sure, ask the teacher whether you made a mistake.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here's a quick review of my main tips for each part of the speaking test:</p>
<p><strong>Part 1</strong><br>Keep it simple; there's no need to show off in this part. Give a short, direct answer and a reason for your answer. Then stop. If necessary, smile at the examiner to show that you are ready for the next question; if you keep speaking, the examiner will interrupt you. Answer using full sentences, and try not to hesitate; just say the first thing that comes into your head.</p>
<p><strong>Part 2</strong><br>Before the exam, prepare ideas for the <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2012/09/ielts-speaking-part-2-main-topics.html">six main topics</a>. Focus on vocabulary, not grammar or linking. In the exam, try to note down as many ideas as you can during the 1-minute preparation time - hopefully you'll be able to use ideas that you have already prepared. You don't have to cover all of the points on the task card, but it helps you to structure your answer if you do. Say as much as you can for each point, and use a real example or story at the end of your description if you need to fill time. Keep going until the examiner stops you.</p>
<p><strong>Part 3</strong><br>Practise "3-step" answers: 1) answer the question 2) explain your answer 3) give an example. There's also a <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2015/03/ielts-speaking-part-3-long-answer-technique.html">4th step</a> that you can sometimes use. By following these steps, you ensure that your answer "moves forward" instead of becoming repetitive - most people repeat the same ideas when they try to give a long answer, and the steps will help you to avoid this.</p>
<p><strong>PS.</strong> I'll publish my next speaking video in the next few days.</p>

				<p>Here are my suggestions for correct, simplified versions of the sentences in yesterday's lesson:</p>
<ol>
<li>People who live in cities face various problems.</li>
<li>The problems that urban inhabitants face include a high cost of living, social problems, and poor air quality.</li>
<li>People who live in cities face various problems.</li>
<li>People who live in urban areas face various challenges.</li>
<li>City life is much more challenging than many people are led to believe.</li>
</ol>
<p><em><strong>Notes:</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Sentences 1 and 3 were trying to communicate the same simple idea, so I used the same easy sentence for both.</li>
<li>Notice that I removed the words 'dwelling' and 'denizen'. Don't try to show off with difficult words in your introduction.</li>
<li>Notice how the verb 'face' is used: A face(s) B. For example: people face problems.</li>

<li>On the one hand, people facing different situation living in a city.</li>
<li>The problems that urban inhabitants may face with are high cost of living, many kinds of social problems as well as poor air quality.</li>

	<p>
				<p>Today I'm working on a video lesson about the "describe an activity" topic. You might be asked to describe a hobby, sport or game, so it's a good idea to be ready for this topic.</p>
<p>My approach is to prepare ideas for one sport (e.g. swimming) and one game (e.g. chess). I start with a simple idea, such as "swimming is healthy". Then I search for good words and phrases related to this theme. For example:</p>
<p>"Swimming is healthy" theme:</p>
<ul>
<li>keep fit</li>
<li>get in better shape</li>
<li>a good cardiovascular workout</li>
<li>feel refreshed, rejuvenated, invigorated</li>
<li>gives me an energy boost</li>
</ul>
<p>Can you think of any more words and phrases for this theme?</p>

<li>Instead of <em><strong>'reduce the pressure'</strong></em>, can we write <em><strong>'cut down the pressure'</strong>?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>My answer is no. Although 'bring down', 'lessen' and 'cut down' can be used as synonyms of 'reduce' in some situations, most native speakers wouldn't choose to use them in the contexts above. In other words, 'reduce pollution' is a common collocation, but 'bring down pollution' isn't.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Later today I'll publish a video lesson about the part 2 topic "Describe a place". One of my suggestions in the lesson is that you prepare some vocabulary 'themes'.</p>
<p>For example, here are some ideas for a description of an interesting city:</p>
<ul>
<li>lively, bustling, hectic, thriving</li>
<li>cosmopolitan, multicultural</li>
<li>fascinating, unique</li>
<li>a special atmosphere</li>
<li>sightseeing, entertainment</li>
<li>an unforgettable experience</li>
<li>enjoyed every minute</li>
<li>the time flew by</li>
<li>endless things to see and do</li>
<li>it was over too quickly</li>
</ul>
<p>The lesson contains more examples of 'theme' language, and you'll hear me giving two full sample answers for two different "Describe a place" questions.</p>

	<p>
				<p>In the comments below <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2016/02/ielts-writing-task-2-disagree-essay-with-both-sides.html">Wednesday's lesson</a>, a few people said that they didn't see any "advanced" vocabulary* in my essay. But examiners are not looking for "advanced" vocabulary; they are looking for "less common" vocabulary.</p>
<p>"Less common" vocabulary means words and phrases that most students wouldn't think to use in their essays. For example, in the first line of my essay, I used the verb "to rival". You might know the noun "rival", but have you ever used it as a verb? This is not an "advanced" word, but it is certainly <em><strong>less commonly used</strong></em> by IELTS candidates, and the examiner would be impressed to see it used in this way.</p>
<p>Here are the "less common" phrases from my essay:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Internet is beginning to rival newspapers</li>
<li>the traditional press</li>
<li>vital source of information</li>
<li>the Internet age</li>
<li>traditional means of communicating</li>
<li>rural areas</li>
<li>the ability or opportunity to get online</li>
<li>trusted as reliable sources</li>
<li>employ professional journalists and editors</li>
<li>news in real time</li>
<li>gadgets and mobile devices</li>
<li>contribute with our own updates on social media</li>
<li>an explosion in the use of platforms</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong><br>Although you probably <em><strong>understand</strong></em> the phrases above, most candidates would not <em><strong>use</strong></em> them in their essays.</p>
<p>*I never use the terms "advanced vocabulary" or "difficult vocabulary". Anyone can find a "big" word in the dictionary and translate it. The difficult skill is to use words together in&nbsp;<a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2013/03/ielts-vocabulary-band-7-or-higher.html">collocations</a> and phrases.</p>

	<p>
				<p>If you didn't manage to watch the video lesson that I published yesterday, here's a quick summary of the key ideas.</p>
<p>In the video, I look at the topic "Describe a person", which is one of the&nbsp;<a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2012/09/ielts-speaking-part-2-main-topics.html">six main topics</a> in part 2 of the speaking test. Here are some possible questions in this topic area:</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe a teacher</li>
<li>Describe a famous person</li>
<li>Describe a friend</li>
<li>Describe a family member</li>
<li>Describe a child</li>
<li>Describe someone who helps people</li>
<li>Describe someone who does something well</li>
</ul>
<p>I then suggest that we choose an easy 'theme' e.g. a hard-working and friendly person. We can prepare lots of good vocabulary for this theme, and hopefully use it to describe <em><strong>any</strong></em> of the people in the list above.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Should you write "most people", "most of people" or "most of the people"?</p>
<p>Answer:</p>

<li>Don't write "most of people".</li>
<li>"Most of the people" is correct when you are talking about a specific group of people e.g. most of the people in my department.</li>
<li>For IELTS writing and speaking "most people" is the best phrase.</li>

				<p>People often ask me about inventing statistics in their task 2 essays. For example, if the question is about crime, they might invent something like this:</p>
<p><em>"According to a recent report from Oxford University, around 60% of prisoners reoffend after being released."</em></p>
<p>Although this looks like a good 'academic-style' sentence, I still wouldn't recommend writing it. Here are two reasons why:</p>
<ol>
<li>As you don't have access to research in your exam, statistics like this always seem 'fake' to the examiner.</li>
<li>Statistics aren't really appropriate for the style of writing that examiners expect. They are expecting an opinion-based essay, not a research-based assignment.</li>
</ol>
<p>Rather than relying on invented statistics, focus on expressing your own views.</p>

<p>So, is it true that we should worry about these things? Do candidates need to use 'new', original language in their tests?</p>

	<p>
				<p>I've written before about the six main topic areas that I think you should prepare:</p>
<ol>
<li>Describe a person (family member, famous person...)</li>
<li>Describe a place (city, holiday...)</li>
<li>Describe an object (something you use, a gift...)</li>
<li>Describe an event (festival, celebration...)</li>
<li>Describe an activity (hobby, game, sport...)</li>
<li>Describe your favourite (book, film, website...)</li>
</ol>
<p>You should also be prepared to talk about your <strong>job</strong> and/or your <strong>studies</strong>.</p>
<p>After preparing one main description for these seven or eight topics, you should then practise <em><strong>adapting</strong></em> your descriptions to as many questions as you can.</p>
<p><em><strong>Example:</strong></em><br>Let's take the "disagreement" question in <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2015/12/ielts-speaking-parts-2-and-3-disagreement-topic.html">this lesson</a> as an example. Can we use one of the main topics above as our answer? Perhaps we could say that we had a family disagreement about where to go on holiday, which gift to buy someone, or which film to see at the cinema. Which topic would you use and adapt for the "disagreement" question?</p>

				<p>People often ask me for advice about overcoming nervousness when they're taking the IELTS test.</p>
<p>Personally, I think it's normal and even helpful to feel nervous before an exam. The feeling that I think you should aim for is a healthy mix of nervousness and determination. The determination comes from knowing that you are well prepared for the challenge; when you feel like this, the nerves usually disappear as soon as you start the first part of the exam.</p>

<p><strong>(Idea / basic answer)</strong> Teenagers disagree with their parents about all sorts of things, like the clothes they want to wear, whether they can go out with their friends, doing homework, and how much help they give their parents around the house. <strong>(Explain why)</strong> I think the teenage years are when we develop a sense of identity, and we want to make our own decisions rather than follow other people's instructions. <strong>(Personal example)</strong> I remember having disagreements with my own parents, usually about simple things like getting up early in the morning, tidying my room, or doing the washing up!</p>
<p><em><strong>Task:</strong></em><br>Can you answer the following question in the same way?</p>
<p><em>Do you think that it's important to be polite?</em></p>

	<p>
				<p>Here are three simple tips that could make a difference to your score:</p>
<p>1. Be confident</p>
<p>Although you might be nervous, try to speak clearly and confidently. Smile and be friendly* with the examiner. As you go into the exam, tell yourself that you have prepared well and that you're going to enjoy the challenge.</p>
<p>2. Know that you are prepared</p>
<p>You will feel much more confident if you know that you have prepared and practised for the test. You should know exactly what to expect. For example, have you prepared some common topics (e.g. describe a place, a person, a hobby) for the short presentation? Are you ready for a past and a future question in part 3?</p>
<p>3. Speak naturally</p>
<p>Try to enjoy a normal conversation with the examiner. Instead of worrying about your grammar, listen carefully to the questions and try to give natural answers. Most of the questions are about you, your life and your opinions, so it's best to be open. I used to be an examiner, and I always found the job more interesting when students spoke openly about their opinions and experiences.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*<em><strong>Note</strong></em><strong>:</strong> You are not marked on body language, but I'd still recommend that you try to act in a friendly, confident manner.</span></p>

	<p>
				<p>A student noticed something interesting in my video lesson about "discussion essays". In the lesson I wrote the following two phrases:</p>
<ol>
<li>their <span style="text-decoration: underline;">determination</span> will help them in competitive situations</li>
<li>more useful than <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a</span> competitive <span style="text-decoration: underline;">determination</span> to win</li>
</ol>
<p>The student asked why I used the article "a" in the second phrase. Isn't "determination" an uncountable noun? The answer is, not always.</p>
<p>Sometimes we use "determination" as a countable noun. In the second sentence above, I'm writing about one specific type of determination: the determination to win. In this case it's correct to write "a determination".</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em><br>People often ask me to make a lesson that explains how to use articles. The problem is that article use doesn't follow a set of simple 'rules'. I think it's best to learn gradually by reading lots of English and by <em><strong>noticing</strong></em> things like the example above.</p>

				<p>A New Year's resolution is an intention or objective for the coming year. The problem is that most people (including me!) break their resolutions - apparently 35% of New Year's resolutions are broken by the end of January.</p>
<p>If you're making a New Year’s resolution related to IELTS, here’s an idea:</p>
<p>We know that the overall aim is to pass the IELTS test, but the best resolutions are <strong><em>small</em></strong> and <strong><em>achievable</em></strong>. It’s disheartening to break a promise that you made to yourself, so start with something very easy. Why not make a <strong><em>short-term</em></strong> resolution for January only? When you've achieved that aim, you can set another one for February. Each aim can become gradually more difficult as you gain confidence.</p>
<p>Do you have a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">small</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">short-term</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">achievable</span> objective for January?

	<p>
				<p>Following on from yesterday's lesson, here are some key points to remember.</p>
<p><strong>1) Superlatives can be used after possessive forms, without "the":</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>My highest IELTS score was...</li>
<li>His fastest running time was...</li>
<li>Britain's oldest person is...</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2) Miss "the" if the noun is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">before</span> (not after) the superlative:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The UK had <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">highest</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">revenue</span> from bananas. (noun after, use "the")</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Revenue</span> from bananas was <span style="text-decoration: underline;">highest</span> in the UK. (noun before, no "the")</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3) Miss "the" when the meaning is "at its..." or "at their...":</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Revenue from bananas was (at its) highest in the UK.</li>
<li>Temperatures are (at their) warmest in the south of the country.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Task:</strong><br>Here's a puzzle for you. The sentence below is correct, but it seems to break the 'rule' in point 2 above. Can you explain why I wrote "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> oldest" even though there is no noun after the superlative?</p>
<p><em>The London underground is the oldest.</em></p>

				<p>In <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2011/12/ielts-grammar-highest-or-the-highest.html">this lesson</a> I gave a grammatical explanation of when to write "highest" without the word "the" before it. For example:</p>
<p>- The UK had <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>the</strong></em> highest rate</span> of unemployment. (the highest + noun)<br>- The unemployment <span style="text-decoration: underline;">rate was highest</span> in the UK. (noun before 'highest', no 'the')</p>
<p>However, there might be an easier way to remember when to miss the word "the".&nbsp; We miss the word "the" when "highest" means "at its highest" or "at their highest" e.g. The unemployment rate was<em><strong> at its highest</strong></em> in the UK.</p>
<p>Let's try this with a few more examples:</p>
<p>1. Rainfall is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">highest</span> in October. (Rainfall is <em><strong>at its highest</strong></em> in October)<br>2. Temperatures are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">warmest</span> in the south of the country. (at their warmest)<br>3. Traffic is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">slowest</span> between 7 and 9am. (at its slowest)</p>
<p>In the above examples, don't put the word "the" before the superlative adjectives.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Last week we looked at the first half of a question:</p>
<p><em><strong>Describe a long walk that you enjoyed.</strong></em><br><em><strong>You should say</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>- when you went on this walk</strong></em><br><em><strong>- where it took place</strong></em></p>
<p>I explained that it would be easy to give a very short answer to these two points:</p>
<p>"<span style="background-color: #e2c1f7;">Last summer</span> I walked <span style="background-color: #e2c1f7;">along a beach</span> during my holiday in..."</p>
<p>But we need to expand this answer to include more information about "when" and "where". For example:</p>
<p><strong>When</strong><br>I’m going to describe a walk that I enjoyed <span style="background-color: #e2c1f7;">last summer</span> while I was on holiday on the south coast of England. It was the <span style="background-color: #e2c1f7;">first week of August</span>, and we set off on the walk <span style="background-color: #e2c1f7;">on the first morning</span> of the holiday <span style="background-color: #e2c1f7;">just after breakfast</span>, at <span style="background-color: #e2c1f7;">around 9 o’clock</span>. The walk took us the <span style="background-color: #e2c1f7;">whole morning</span> and finished at lunchtime.</p>
<p><strong>Where</strong><br>As I mentioned, the walk took place on the <span style="background-color: #e2c1f7;">south coast of England</span>. I was on holiday with my family in a place called <span style="background-color: #e2c1f7;">Dorset</span>, and we were staying in a rented house. Our aim was to walk <span style="background-color: #e2c1f7;">from the house to a place called Durdle Door beach</span>. First we had to <span style="background-color: #e2c1f7;">find the coast path</span>, and then we <span style="background-color: #e2c1f7;">followed this path</span> for several miles until we reached Durdle Door and finally <span style="background-color: #e2c1f7;">descended the steep steps that led to the beach</span>.<br><span style="color: #ffffff;">...</span></p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c01b7c7f4b225970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Unknown" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c01b7c7f4b225970b img-responsive" src="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c01b7c7f4b225970b-800wi" title="Unknown"></a><br><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Durdle Door</span></p>

	<p>
				<p>Here's a question that a student wrote in the "comments" below one of my lessons this week:</p>
<p><em>Dear Simon,</em></p>
<p><em>I'm reading your model essays and find them easy to follow and understand. They are totally different from what I'm being trained to write in my IELTS class. We are advised to include linking words, adverbs and descriptive clauses in almost every sentence, while your sentences are much shorter and cleaner. Please give me your opinion about this difference.</em></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Note: I've corrected a few small mistakes that the student made)</span></p>
<p>For me, this is an important question because it highlights one of the main reasons why I started writing this blog: I disagree with the way that many teachers, books and websites teach IELTS, and I wanted to suggest a different approach. Examiners are pleasantly surprised when they see essays that are 'clean' and easy to follow, and you might find that your scores improve as you start to focus on <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2015/09/ielts-writing-task-2-focus-on-real-content.html">real content</a> instead of linking words and memorised phrases.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Many people find it difficult to keep talking for 2 minutes because they give very quick answers to one or two of the bullet points on the task card.</p>
<p>Take last week's question for example:</p>
<p><em><strong>Describe a long walk that you enjoyed.</strong></em><br><em><strong>You should say</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>- when you went on this walk</strong></em><br><em><strong>- where it took place</strong></em><br><em><strong>- what you saw while you were walking</strong></em><br><em><strong>- and explain why you enjoyed the walk.</strong></em></p>
<p>It would be easy to answer the first two bullet points very quickly:</p>
<p><em>"Last summer I walked along a beach during my holiday in..."</em></p>
<p>The problem now is that we need to spend almost the full 2 minutes on the last two bullet points. It would be better if we could expand on all four points, like I did in <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2015/10/ielts-speaking-part-2-educa.html">this lesson</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Task:</strong><br>Can you invent some more information to expand on the short answer that I gave above (about walking along a beach last summer)? Try to invent as much as you can about the "when" and the "where".</p>

	<p>
				<p>Many people ask me how they can improve their IELTS scores. In my experience, improvements tend to happen in the following way:</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c017c36ea12ad970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Screen Shot 2013-02-16 at 17.32.35" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c017c36ea12ad970b" src="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c017c36ea12ad970b-800wi" title="Screen Shot 2013-02-16 at 17.32.35"></a></p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> </em>The numbers on the graph refer to stages of improvement, not scores.</p>
<p>Here's my explanation of the four stages of improvement:</p>
<ol>
<li>When a student first starts taking IELTS lessons, they learn useful exam techniques and they do some practice tests. They often improve quite quickly at this stage.</li>
<li>However, there is a limit to the improvements that you can make with exam techniques alone. Stage 2 represents the frustrating period during which your score stays the same.</li>
<li>The only way to reach point 3 is by working hard to improve your English. There are no secrets, shortcuts or special techniques; learning a second language takes time and practice.</li>
<li>In the end, students who persist do tend to get the scores they need! (I'm afraid nobody can tell you how long this will take).</li>

	<p>
				<p>Here are my sample answers to the questions that I shared with you last week. Notice that I use the 3 or 4 steps that I recommended, and remember to note down any good words or phrases that you find.</p>
<p><em><strong>1. Do you think most people watch TV for education or for entertainment?</strong></em></p>
<p>I think people watch TV primarily for entertainment. There are far more entertainment programmes than educational ones, and in my experience most people treat television as a form of relaxation in the evening. If I think about the most popular TV programmes in the UK, such as talent shows like 'X Factor' or soap operas like 'Eastenders', the focus is definitely on entertainment rather than education.</p>
<p><em><strong>2. Should TV play a role in educating children? How?</strong></em></p>
<p>Yes, it definitely should play a role in my opinion. Good children's TV programmes should tell stories that contain some kind of lesson about how to behave or what is morally right and wrong. Many of the traditional fairy tales, such as 'Cinderella', have been made into TV programmes, and there is always a positive message in those stories.</p>
<p><em><strong>3. How do you think TV viewing habits change as people get older?</strong></em></p>
<p>TV viewing habits obviously change a lot as we get older. While toddlers might watch programmes about talking animals, teenagers prefer action and adventure or sports, and as adults we start taking an interest in news and politics. My own preferences, for example, have changed over the years - I would never have watched news programmes when I was younger. I think it would be very strange if our viewing habits didn't mature!</p>

	<p>
				<p>After the part 2 question that I showed you in last week's <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2015/10/ielts-speaking-part-2-educa.html" target="_self" title="">lesson</a>, the examiner would ask you some related questions in part 3 of the test.</p>
<p>Here are some part 3 questions about the 'educational TV programme' topic:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do you think most people watch TV for education or for entertainment?</li>
<li>Should TV play a role in educating children? How?</li>
<li>How do you think TV viewing habits change as people get older?</li>
</ol>
<p><em><strong>Tip:</strong></em><br>The secret to giving good answers in part 3 is to follow three simple steps: 1) give a direct answer 2) explain in more detail 3) give an example. There's also a 4th step if you want to say even more. Look at <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2015/03/ielts-speaking-part-3-long-answer-technique.html" target="_self" title="">this lesson</a> to see an example.</p>

<p>I can't exactly remember, but it was probably in my first year at primary school when I was 5 years old. I probably learnt simple addition at that age.</p>
<p><em><strong>2) Do you like mathematics? Why / why not?</strong></em></p>
<p>I don't dislike maths, but I wouldn't say that I've ever really liked the subject either. I'm happy to do simple calculations, but my brain can't cope with the complex stuff!</p>
<p><em><strong>3) Is it necessary for everyone to learn mathematics?</strong></em></p>
<p>Yes, I think it is. We all need a basic grounding in maths so that we can do daily tasks, like managing our money, working out bills, and so on.</p>
<p><em><strong>4) Do you prefer to use a calculator when doing mathematics?</strong></em></p>
<p>It depends. I quite like exercising my brain with anything that's easy enough, but I use the calculator on my phone for anything tricky.</p>

				<p>In yesterday's lesson I mentioned that someone asked me this question: "Can we use the passive in writing task 1?"</p>
<p>If you ask a question like this, it tells me that you're focusing on the wrong thing. Your method, or your whole approach to the IELTS test is wrong.</p>
<p>When you look at a graph or chart in writing task 1, you shouldn't be thinking, "can I use the passive to describe this information?". You should be thinking, "what is the main trend, which numbers should I compare or contrast, how will I paraphrase the question etc.?".</p>
<p>Don't take a 'grammar approach' to your IELTS preparation. Take a 'task response' approach: focus on answering the question.</p>

	<p>
				<p>"Describe a hobby" seems like an easy topic. However, students often have difficulty speaking for 2 minutes when the topic is easy.</p>
<p>Here are 3 pieces of advice to help you to speak for 2 minutes. I'll use photography as the hobby in my example answers.</p>
<p><strong><em>1. Think about question words: What, when, where, why, who with:</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What: One of my hobbies is photography.</li>
<li>When and where: I take photos on my phone almost every day, and I have a proper camera that I use on special occasions. If I see something interesting or I want to record a particular memory, I take photos wherever I am.</li>
<li>Why: I take photos so that I have a record of the things I’ve seen or done.</li>
<li>Who with: Most of my photos are of friends and family, but I also take pictures of interesting things that I see.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>2. Describe opinions and feelings:</em></strong></p>
<p>I like photography because it’s a creative hobby and it makes you notice the world around you. I love capturing special moments or unusual or beautiful images, and it’s a great feeling to be able to look back through my pictures and relive different experiences. These memories usually cheer me up.</p>
<p><strong><em>3. Tell a story related to the topic:</em></strong></p>
<p>The last time I took photos on a special occasion was at my friend’s wedding a few weeks ago. I got some great pictures of the bride and groom and their guests celebrating. After the wedding I made an album of all the best pictures and sent it to my friend as a present.</p>
<p><em><strong>Task:</strong></em><br>Try describing your own hobby using the 3 tips above.</p>

<p><em>"After multiple attempts of taking the exam, I was able to get my needed scores on my 4th try. What's astonishing is I got 7 in writing, my weakest part, after the remarking. I know thousands of people are struggling to get their desired scores but all I can say is 'Do not give up'.

				<p>A colleague of mine (thanks Phil) just sent me a link to an online dictionary called <a href="http://www.yourdictionary.com" target="_self" title="">Your Dictionary</a>. The best feature of this dictionary is that it shows you lots of example sentences that include the word you searched for.</p>
<p>Try searching for a word, and then click on the 'sentences' option:</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c01b8d155fc66970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Screen Shot 2015-09-11 at 09.58.38" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c01b8d155fc66970c img-responsive" src="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c01b8d155fc66970c-320wi" title="Screen Shot 2015-09-11 at 09.58.38"></a></p>

	<p>
				<p>Here are my negative answers to the questions in last week's speaking lesson. Remember: I'm imagining that I don't like (or know about) the topic.</p>
<p><em><strong>1) Do you like music?</strong></em></p>
<p>No, I don't really like music, and I don't listen to it. It's not something that I've ever been interested in.</p>
<p><em><strong>2) What kind of music did you listen to when you were young?</strong></em></p>
<p>I can't remember listening to much music as a child either. I suppose I must have heard some traditional music at festivals or parties, but I didn't take much notice of it.</p>
<p><em><strong>3) When was the last time you went to a concert?</strong></em></p>
<p>I've never been to a music concert. Maybe I should try going to one; perhaps it would be interesting to see an orchestra playing classical music.</p>
<p><strong><em>4) Would you like to participate in a live music show?</em></strong></p>
<p>No, definitely not. I don't play a musical instrument and I don't sing, so I can't imagine that I'd ever find myself performing to an audience.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em><br>My aim here is to show you that you can answer questions about <span style="text-decoration: underline;">any</span> topic - you don't need to like it or know anything about it. (I do like music by the way!)</p>

	<p>
				<p>People often ask me what they should do if the examiner asks about a topic that they don't like or don't know anything about. Take the topic of 'music' for example. This is an easy topic for some people, but others find it difficult because they don't usually listen to music.</p>
<p>Let's imagine that you don't like music and you don't know anything about it. How would you answer the following questions in part 1 of the test? Try to give negative answers, but make sure that they are still good answers!</p>
<ol>
<li>Do you like music?</li>
<li>What kind of music did you listen to when you were young?</li>
<li>When was the last time you went to a concert?</li>
<li>Would you like to participate in a live music show?</li>
</ol>
<p><em><strong>Remember:</strong></em> You might not like a topic, but this doesn't mean you can't answer the questions. IELTS speaking questions never require 'knowledge', only simple ideas and opinions.</p>

				<p>Did you notice that I used the 'future perfect' tense in the answer that I wrote for Thursday's <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2015/08/ielts-writing-task-1-school-buildings-answer.html" target="_self" title="">writing task 1 lesson</a>? Here's the sentence:</p>
<p><em>- By 2024, a third building will have been constructed.</em></p>
<p>In fact, this is a 'future perfect passive' sentence. Another option was to write:</p>
<p><em>- In 2024, a third building will be constructed.</em> (simple future, passive)</p>
<p>There's a small difference in meaning between these two sentences. The future perfect sentence suggests that construction of the building will <span style="text-decoration: underline;">already</span> be finished in 2024, whereas the simple future sentence suggests that the construction work will happen <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in</span> the year 2024.</p>

	<p>
				<p>A teacher in China asked me to help with the following queries:</p>
<p><strong>1) Can students ask the IELTS examiner to repeat a question?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. They can say something like: "Sorry, can you repeat that please?". It won't affect your score if you do this.</p>
<p><strong>2) Can students ask the examiner to clarify a question?</strong></p>
<p>Not in part 1 or 2. The examiner can only repeat the same question in part 1, and refer you to the task card in part 2. In part 3, it's fine for students to ask for clarification e.g. "Sorry, I'm not sure what you mean by that". The examiner is allowed to rephrase the question in part 3. If you ask for clarification once, it shouldn't affect your score, but don't do this too many times!</p>
<p><strong>3) Can students ask the examiner to define a word?</strong></p>
<p>Again, only in part 3. The student could say: "Sorry, could you explain what you mean by... (unknown word)?"</p>
<p><strong>4) Can students ask for more time to think?</strong></p>
<p>I don't recommend doing that. Students lose marks for long hesitations, so it's best for them to practise answering quickly.</p>
<p><strong>5) Can students ask to miss a question in parts 1 and 3?</strong></p>
<p>They can, but they will lose points, so I don't recommend doing this. It's always best to attempt an answer.</p>
<p><strong>6) Can students ask for a different topic in part 2?</strong></p>
<p>No. They must take the topic card that the examiner gives them.</p>

<p>Here are some of their worries:</p>

<li>What should I say if I do both (work and study)?</li>
<li>What if I normally work, but now I'm studying for the IELTS test?</li>
<li>I've just moved to a new country. Which country should I talk about?</li>
</ul>
<p>My advice is to stop worrying, and just explain your situation. For example: "I'm a qualified doctor, but at the moment I'm studying English so that I can work here in the UK."</p>

	<h4><a href="https://www.ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2015/08/ielts-speaking-part-2-local-area-answer.html">IELTS Speaking Part 2: 'local area' answer</a></h4>
	<p>
				<p><em><strong>Describe a change that you would like to see in your local area.</strong></em><br><em><strong>You should say</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>- what the change would be</strong></em><br><em><strong>- who would be involved in making the change</strong></em><br><em><strong>- how it would be done</strong></em><br><em><strong>- and why you would like to see the change happen.</strong></em></p>
<p>Here's my band 9 sample answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>The change that I’d like to see in my local neighbourhood is the pedestrianisation of the main shopping street in the town centre. I’d like to see traffic diverted around this area in order to make it safer and more attractive for visitors and shoppers. Most of the traffic that clogs up the main street is just passing through the town, but it’s the local people who have to put up with the congestion, noise and pollution.</li>
<li>It’s the job of the local council to make changes like the one I’m suggesting. But before the council does anything, there usually needs to be some pressure from local people to bring a problem to light. So, perhaps we need a campaign by local residents who want to see this change. Then the council might contract a town planner or an architect to come up with some possible designs for a new road system.</li>
<li>I’m not sure how exactly the process of creating a pedestrian street would work, but I imagine that it would require detailed planning. Perhaps a bypass would need to be built around the town centre first. This would give drivers a faster alternative to driving through the town, and it would allow the main shopping street to be blocked off and pedestrianised.</li>
<li>I’d like to see this change because it would really improve the quality of life of residents in the town where I live. I can imagine the new pedestrian street having cafes and restaurants with outdoor seating. It would be a safer and more pleasant place for families to go shopping, and I’m sure this would have a positive knock-on effect on local shops and businesses.</li>
</ul>

	<p>
				<p>When I was at school I studied French. The teachers taught us lots of grammar, and after five or six years we were ready to learn passives, conditionals and the subjunctive. These were considered to be the the most advanced aspects of the language.</p>
<p>But then I went to France, and realised that I was still a beginner! I couldn't understand fast speech, and I couldn't express myself without thinking first; I needed time to construct sentences in my head.</p>
<p>Now I have a different view about what 'advanced' or 'difficult' language is, and <em><strong>the IELTS marking system agrees with me</strong></em>. An 'advanced' user of English isn't someone who uses lots of passives and conditionals. An advanced user is someone who has a large language <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2011/10/ielts-advice-your-repertoire.html" target="_self" title="">repertoire</a>, can explain ideas in detail, can speak without thinking (too much), and can express the same idea in a variety of ways. Which type of 'advanced' are you tryng to reach?</p>

<ol>
<li>Spend more time planning, and try to think of 3 distinct ideas or points before you start writing. When you've written about one point, leave it and move on to the next one.</li>
<li>Spend more time planning, and develop your idea (if you only have one idea). Make sure you don't just explain the same point in different ways. Instead, try to "move the idea forward" by thinking about reasons, consequences and examples. You could even consider alternatives e.g. what the opposite of your idea would be.</li>

				<p>Whenever you see a new word or phrase, it's a good idea to investigate. By this I mean that you should search for the word or phrase online, and see how it is used in a variety of sentences.</p>
<p>For example, take this phrase from yesterday's lesson: <em><strong>"I'm not one for..."</strong></em>. If you search for this phrase on Google, you'll see examples like:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm not one for complaining, but...</li>
<li>I'm not one for writing reviews, but...</li>
<li>I'm not one for settling for mediocrity.</li>
<li>I'm not one for love songs.</li>
<li>I'm not one for celeb news.</li>
<li>I'm not one for too much structure.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think you need to see five or more examples of a new phrase before you start to really see how you could use it yourself. Can you see any 'rules' for the phrase "I'm not one for"? Can you explain what it means? Can you use it in your own sentences?</p>

<p>Here's my sample answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m going to talk about a film that I’d like to see when it comes out later this year. It’s the new James Bond film, and I saw in the news that it’s going to be called ‘Spectre’. I think ‘Spectre’ refers to the name of the imaginary criminal organisation that James Bond has to defeat in the film.</li>
<li>As ‘Spectre’ hasn’t been released yet, I don’t know exactly what it will be about. But I can guess that the hero, Bond, is going to be on a mission to save the world from an arch-criminal as usual. I’m sure it will be similar to most of the previous Bond films, with a plot line involving lots of twists and turns, and with Bond using his skills to defeat his nemesis in the end.</li>
<li>I first heard about this film when I was watching the news a couple of months ago, and since then I’ve seen the official trailer on TV. There have also been various articles in newspapers discussing the actors who have been cast to play supporting roles in the film. The James Bond films are always big news here in the UK, probably because Bond himself is an English character.</li>
<li>I’d like to see ‘Spectre’ at the cinema because I’m sure it will be full of action scenes and special effects, and I like the fact that Bond’s missions always take place in spectacular locations in different parts of the world. Of course Bond films are totally unrealistic, you could even say ridiculous. But they're always fast, entertaining and fun, a bit like a roller-coaster ride!</li>

				<p>This week someone asked me a question which included the following statement:</p>
<p><em>Some examiners do not agree with the use of "I" in the writing test.</em></p>
<p>My question is: who are these examiners? I can't believe that examiners would ignore their training and penalise the use of "I". How are candidates expected to answer the question "Do <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you</span> agree or disagree?" without using "I" or "my" (e.g. I completely disagree)? Also, if the personal pronoun "you" is used in the question, why would personal pronouns be prohibited in your answer?</p>
<p>My guess is that this misinformation about the use of "I" is coming from teachers, not examiners. In my experience here in the UK, examiners are all well trained and they all work in the same way. They <em><strong>expect</strong></em> you to use phrases like "I believe" or "I agree" when the question asks for your opinion!</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here are my sample answers to the questions in last week's lesson.</p>
<p><em><strong>1. Do you like studying? Why / why not?</strong></em></p>
<p>Yes, I like studying because it's the best way to gain a deeper insight into any subject. I like reading, learning from others, and trying to understand difficult concepts.</p>
<p><em><strong>2. Do you prefer to study alone or with others? Why?</strong></em></p>
<p>I prefer to study alone because I need to be able to concentrate fully. Other people are a distraction.</p>
<p><em><strong>3. Where do you prefer to go when you need to study? Why?</strong></em></p>
<p>I like to find a quiet corner in my local library; being in an old building and surrounded by books seems to help me to focus on my work.</p>
<p><em><strong>4. How do you feel if someone disturbs you when you are studying?</strong></em></p>
<p>It frustrates me because it breaks my concentration. I prefer to avoid distractions by going somewhere where nobody will interrupt me.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here's a question that I mentioned in a lesson a few weeks ago:</p>
<p><em><strong>Describe a prize that you would like to win. You should explain</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>- what the prize is for</strong></em><br><em><strong>- how you know about it</strong></em><br><em><strong>- what you would have to do to win it</strong></em><br><em><strong>- and why you would like to win this prize.</strong></em></p>
<p>And here's my sample answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m going to talk about a prize that I would like to win, which is the ‘employee of the year’ award at the company where I work. At the end of December each year, the company directors give this award to a member of staff who has made an outstanding contribution to the business over the previous twelve months.</li>
<li>I first heard about this prize during my training and orientation period just after I got the job three years ago. It was early December and some of my colleagues were discussing who might be awarded ‘employee of the year’ later that month. I was intrigued, and asked them to tell me more about the award.</li>
<li>As I said, the prize is given for ‘outstanding contribution to the business’. We don’t have an exact definition of what this means, but we assume that you have to achieve certain standards, such as 100% attendance, good punctuality, meeting targets and deadlines, good teamwork, and so on. I think the winner also needs to have done something especially creative. For example, last year’s winner created a completely new service for our clients.</li>
<li>I’d like to win ‘employee of the year’ because it would mean that my work had been recognised by the company directors, and this would definitely help me to progress in my career. It would also give me a great sense of personal achievement.</li>

	<p>
				<p>At the end of yesterday's speaking lesson, I made an important point:</p>
<p>You need to be <em><strong>conscious</strong></em> of the techniques that you are using as you answer questions in the exam (especially in the speaking and writing tests). Otherwise you'll go back to your 'old technique' of saying or writing whatever comes into your head.</p>
<p>Let me explain this a bit more with an example:</p>
<p>When I teach students the 3-step technique that I mentioned yesterday (answer, explain, example), they have no problem understanding it. However, when I then ask some sample questions, most people seem to forget the technique completely. They miss the example, or they give a list of two or three answers with no explanation.</p>
<p><strong>Ask yourself:</strong> are you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">consciously</span> using the exam techniques that you have learnt, or do you fall back into old habits when under pressure?</p>

	<p>
				<p>When I was an examiner, I remember that not many candidates performed well towards the end of the speaking test. After trying really hard in parts 1 and 2, many people seemed to run out of energy when they got to part 3.</p>
<p>So, how can you make sure that you finish strongly and do well in part 3?</p>
<p>I think the secret is to answer according to a simple 3-step formula: answer the question directly, then explain in detail, then give an example (e.g. a personal experience). I've included a fourth step in <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2015/03/ielts-speaking-part-3-long-answer-technique.html" target="_self" title="">this lesson</a>, but the first 3 steps are the easiest to use.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> You need to practise consciously going through the 3 steps as you give an answer (maybe you could count the steps on your fingers). Otherwise, you'll go back to your old technique of saying whatever comes into your head!</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here are some recent part 1 questions, with my example answers.</p>
<p><em><strong>1. Do you like cooking? Why / why not?</strong></em></p>
<p>Sometimes. I like preparing a special meal for family or friends who visit, but everyday cooking is a bit boring; it's something that has to be done, but it's not really fun.</p>
<p><em><strong>2. Who did the cooking in your family when you were a child?</strong></em></p>
<p>My mother almost always did the cooking when I was young. I don't think she trusted my father to make a nice meal.</p>
<p><em><strong>3. Do you think that it's important to know how to cook well?</strong></em></p>
<p>I'm not sure whether it's important to cook <em>well</em>, but I do think that everyone should know the basics. It definitely isn't healthy to rely on pre-prepared meals or fast food.</p>
<p><em><strong>4. Do you think that children should be taught cookery at school?</strong></em></p>
<p>Yes, that's probably a good idea. If all children knew how to cook a few basic, healthy meals, that would surely be a good thing.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Yesterday I explained why nobody can create a list of 'band 9 phrases for any essay'. So, is there any way to prepare band 7-9 vocabulary for the test?</p>
<p>The answer is yes, but I'm afraid you will need to make many lists, not just one! I advise my students to prepare ideas and opinions for as many common IELTS topics as possible. <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2011/02/ielts-advice-you-need-ideas-and-opinions.html" target="_self" title="">Click here</a> to see the basic list that I use.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here's an interesting question that someone asked me on Facebook:</p>
<p><em>Can you add on your blog some typical phrases (band 9) that we can use in every essay?</em></p>
<p>This seems to be the 'secret' that so many people are looking for. The problem is that these phrases <em><strong>do not exist</strong></em>. I'll try to explain why.</p>
<p>To get a high score for vocabulary and task response, you need to use words and phrases that are specific to the particular question that you are given. For example, if the question is about the environment, you could write about 'greenhouse gases' or 'carbon dioxide emissions'. But these phrases cannot be used in every essay; they are only relevant to this one topic.</p>
<p>The only phrases that can be used in every essay would be 'linking' phrases, and these do not contribute to your vocabulary or task response scores. They only help you to organise your ideas.</p>
<p>So, please stop looking for 'any essay' phrases. Tomorrow I'll explain what to do instead.</p>

				<p>People often ask whether their accent will affect their IELTS score. The simple answer is no. Your score for pronunciation depends on how clearly you speak and how intelligible (easy to understand) you are.</p>

	<h4><a href="https://www.ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2015/04/ielts-advice-score-fluctuations.html">IELTS Advice: score fluctuations</a></h4>
	<p>
				<p>Yesterday I explained why it's normal for your scores to fluctuate between tests. Now I'm going to try to suggest some ways to deal with this.</p>
<p><strong>1. Keep retaking the test</strong></p>
<p>This advice might surprise you, but I remember a student who booked 4 tests in one month. He understood that his scores would fluctuate, but he hoped to improve his chances of having a 'lucky day' when everything went well. It worked! The student told me that the main benefit of taking the test every week was that he stopped feeling nervous. On the third Saturday he performed well in all 4 parts of the test and achieved the scores he needed. <em>*But read the warning below!</em></p>
<p><strong>2. Practise until you over-perform</strong></p>
<p>To get a band 7 in exam conditions, you probably need to be achieving band 7.5 when practising at home. Most people perform worse in real tests due to nerves, so make sure you can comfortably get the score you need before taking the test.</p>
<p><strong>3. Be more consistent in your approach</strong></p>
<p>You might think that you always write essays in the same way, but most people don't. One of my aims in these lessons is to encourage people to use the exact same method every time. For example, I always try to write&nbsp;<a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2015/02/ielts-writing-task-1-9-sentences.html" target="_self" title="">9 sentences</a> for writing task 1, and&nbsp;<a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2015/02/ielts-writing-task-2-13-sentences.html" target="_self" title="">13 sentences</a> for task 2. If you can't say how many sentences you usually write, you're probably not being consistent. I'm using writing as an example, but there are methods for the other parts too.</p>
<p><em><strong>Notes:</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>*<em>Warning</em>: Strategy number 1 can be expensive, and there are no guarantees that it will work. Only try this if you are able to get the score you need in each part and you keep missing your target by 0.5 band in just one part of the test.</li>
<li>Strategy&nbsp;number 2 is sensible, but some people don't want to wait until they can over-perfom.</li>
<li>Strategy&nbsp;number 3 is my favourite. If I can help students to become more consistent, I feel like I'm doing my job as a teacher!</li>

	<p>
				<p>People often wonder why their IELTS scores fluctuate. For example, they might get a band 7 in writing one week, but only band 6 or 6.5 the next week.</p>
<p>Does this mean that the test is unreliable or that you had a bad examiner?</p>
<p>Probably not. Fluctuations are normal, both in the exam and when you are practising at home. For example, I've seen the same fluctuations in the quality of students' homework. Sometimes they have great ideas for the essay topic, or they find the answers easily in a reading test. Other times everything seems to go wrong; they have a bad day, and get lower scores.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I'll talk a bit more about this, and I'll try to suggest some strategies for dealing with this 'fluctuation' problem.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Students often worry that they need to use "complex structures" in the speaking test. But what is a complex structure?</p>
<p><a href="http://jigsaw.wikispaces.com/file/view/Sentences+-+Simple,+Compound,+and+Complex+-+eslbee+dot+com.pdf" target="_self" title="">This website</a> explains the difference between simple sentences, compound sentences and complex sentences. You'll notice that compound and complex sentences are <em><strong>much easier</strong></em> than they sound! I'm sure you use them all the time without realising it.</p>
<p>Here's my advice: stop worrying about the need for "complex" grammar. Instead, focus on expressing your <em><strong>ideas</strong></em> well. As you explain your ideas in detail, you will naturally produce longer sentences which contain a variety of grammatical features.</p>

				<p>Here's a recent question that a few people told me about:</p>

<p>It should be easy to answer this question by adapting a topic that you have already prepared. For example, you could describe a prize related to your studies, a work prize (e.g. employee of the month!), a sport or hobby prize, or even a TV programme prize (e.g. winning a holiday or a new car on a game show).</p>

	<p>
				<p>How do you know when you're ready to take the IELTS exam? Here's my advice:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you've never taken the exam before, take it as soon as you can. You'll be surprised how difficult a full day of testing is! Treat your first attempt as a practice test to get used to what it 'feels' like. Also, taking the exam is the best way to assess your level.</li>
<li>Your next step could be to read about the best ways (techniques, methods) of doing each part of the exam; this is what I try to provide here on the website. Read my advice, analyse my model answers, and try to copy the way I approach each part of the test.</li>
<li>Using what you have learnt, you need to practise and train yourself. This is not the same as testing yourself. Read <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2015/03/ielts-advice-testing-or-training.html" target="_self" title="">yesterday's lesson</a> to understand the difference.</li>
<li>Finally, you need to do some tests and get feedback. You need to find out what you are doing wrong and what you need to do to improve. The best form of feedback is from a teacher who can read your essays or listen to you speak.</li>
</ol>
<p>You will know that you are ready when you consistently get the score you need in all of your practice tests.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Many students prepare for the IELTS exam by doing lots of practice tests. But too much testing is a bad idea.</p>
<p>I think that there is a difference between 'testing' and 'training'.</p>
<p><strong>Testing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>shows you what your current level is</li>
<li>gets you used to working in exam conditions (e.g. with a time limit)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>means that you focus on vocabulary for a particular topic</li>
<li>or work on particular grammar mistakes</li>
<li>or work on a technique for a particular part of the exam</li>
</ul>
<p>A good example of training is when you practise writing introductions. Sometimes I spend a whole lesson with my students just doing different introductions. We practise one technique until students become good at it.</p>
<p>So, how much 'training' and how much 'testing' should you do? Well, a good idea might be to spend Monday to Friday training, preparing and working on language. Then test yourself at the weekend - if you've worked hard, you might see an improvement!</p>

<p><em><strong>Do you think that it's better to have clear aims for the future, or is it best to take each day as it comes?</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>(Answer)</strong> I think it’s best to have a good idea of what you want to do with your life, especially in terms of studies and career. <strong>(Why)</strong> Having aims allows you to plan what you need to do today and tomorrow in order to achieve longer-term objectives. <strong>(Example)</strong> For example, if you want to become a doctor, you need to choose the right subjects at school, get the right exam results, and work hard at university. <strong>(Opposite)</strong> Without a clear aim, it would be impossible to take the necessary steps towards a career in medicine, or any other profession.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Listening</span><br>Use the breaks to read ahead. When they give you half a minute to check your answers, <strong><em>don't</em></strong>. Use the time to get ready for the next section.</p>

				<p>Sometimes the noun form and the verb form of a word are the same. For example, the word “increase” can be a noun or a verb. The problem is that nouns and verbs are used differently. Here are some examples:</p>

<p>Yes. When I was younger I used to collect keyrings. I remember that my favourite was a Lego man keyring that someone bought me as a present.</p>
<p><em><strong>2) What kinds of thing do people often like collecting?</strong></em></p>
<p>Some people collect cheap items like stamps, keyrings or toys. Others collect expensive antiques, watches, jewellery or even cars.</p>
<p><em><strong>3) Why do you think people collect certain objects?</strong></em></p>
<p>Maybe they like the constant search for a new item, or they want to remember past experiences. Others might like the feeling of organising and presenting what they own.</p>
<p><em><strong>4) Is there anything that you would like to collect in the future?</strong></em></p>
<p>Yes. If I could afford it, I'd love to have a collection of guitars in different colours, shapes and sizes!</p>

				<p>A student asked me the following question:</p>
<p><em>Will it help my score if I write a longer essay for writing task 2 - because a longer essay will contain more vocabulary?</em></p>
<p>Here's my answer:</p>
<p>Quality is more important than quantity in the IELTS writing test. If you write a longer essay, you <em><strong>might</strong></em> demonstrate a wider range of vocabulary. On the other hand, you might just repeat the same ideas, and you might make more mistakes.</p>
<p>I don't teach my students to write longer essays (anything over 250 words is fine). I teach them to spend 10 minutes planning good ideas, rather than trying to write more words. In my view, planning is the secret to improving the quality.</p>

				<p>Do the 3 parts of the speaking test carry equal weighting when your score is calculated, or is one part more important?</p>
<p>The simple answer is that the 3 parts are not scored separately; the examiner rates the student's performance as a whole. In this sense, neither part is more important.</p>
<p>However, it's useful to think about the 3 parts like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Part 1 is supposed to be quite easy (like a warm-up), so you won't get a high score if you <em><strong>only</strong></em> do well in this part.</li>
<li>Part 2 is when the examiner really gets a chance to assess how good you are. He/she will now have an idea of what scores to give you.</li>
<li>During part 3, the examiner is making his/her final decision. A good performance here can boost your score.</li>

				<p>Last month I forgot to write a sample answer for the question below.</p>
<p><em><strong>Describe an aim or goal that you hope to achieve in the future.</strong></em><br><em><strong>You should say</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>- what the aim is</strong></em><br><em><strong>- when you hope to achieve it</strong></em><br><em><strong>- what you need to do to reach your goal</strong></em><br><em><strong>- and why this goal is important to you.</strong></em></p>
<p>Here's my answer. Can you find any 'less common vocabulary' in it?</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m going to describe a future aim of mine, which is to write a book. I’d like to write a novel, so the story or plot would be fictional, but it would probably be influenced by some of my own experiences, ideas and views.</li>
<li>Unfortunately I have no idea where to start or what my novel would be about, so I can’t imagine achieving this aim until later in my life. Maybe it will be something that I do as a hobby when I retire, or I might suddenly be inspired to start writing much sooner. It’s just a vague objective at the moment.</li>
<li>I think it must be extremely difficult to find the motivation to write a novel, so more than anything I would need time, commitment and the passion to keep working until I finished. I would probably need to set a goal of writing for a certain amount of time each day, and of course I’d need a good idea for a story in the first place.</li>
<li>This goal interests me because I’ve always wondered how people manage to create a work of fiction from nothing; I’ve always wondered whether I could do the same, and whether I’d be capable of bringing a story to life. I’ve always enjoyed reading, and I’d like to follow in the footsteps of my favourite authors.</li>

<li>There is an array of reasons for the proliferation of high amounts of waste disposal.</li>
<li>There are various reasons for the rise in the amount of waste that we produce.</li>
</ol>
<p>Although sentence 1 might look more 'difficult' (due to the use of <em>array</em>, <em>proliferation</em> and <em>disposal</em>), I definitely prefer sentence 2.</p>
<p>The problem with sentence 1 is that it seems forced and unnatural:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Array of reasons" is fine, although no better than "various reasons".</li>
<li>"Proliferation" and "high amounts" sound strange together. I would use one or the other, but not both.</li>
<li>"The proliferation of waste disposal" also sounds wrong to a native speaker. It isn't a collocation that I would expect to read or hear.</li>
<li>I think the topic would be about "waste production", not "waste disposal". The root problem is that we are producing more waste, not that we are throwing it away more often. The word "disposal" looks good, but for me it affects the coherence of the sentence.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think this is a great example of what I said in Wednesday's <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2015/01/ielts-writing-task-2-the-confidence-to-be-simple.html" target="_self" title="">lesson</a> about having the confidence to keep it simple.

<p>Here's how you could adapt to the question above:</p>
<ul>
<li>Talk about a project or piece of work that you did alone, and pretend that other people were involved.</li>
<li>Go back to your school days and talk about something you studied, pretending that it was a group project.</li>

<p>Yes. Whenever I go somewhere new, I plan my journey with the help of a map.</p>
<p><em><strong>2. When do people usually need to use a map?</strong></em></p>
<p>I imagine that some people use a map every day if they travel to different places for work. Others might only use a map when they're on holiday.</p>
<p><em><strong>3. Do you prefer electronic or paper maps?</strong></em></p>
<p>I still prefer paper maps for a long journey; I like being able to open the map out on a table and see the full journey ahead.</p>
<p><em><strong>4. Do you ever ask people for directions instead of using a map?</strong></em></p>
<p>Only if I'm really lost. Whenever I ask for directions, I find it difficult to remember what the person said. So I prefer to find my own way.</p>

	<h4><a href="https://www.ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2015/01/ielts-grammar-wide-range-or-error-free.html">IELTS Grammar: wide range or error-free?</a></h4>
	<p>
				<p>A student, Kishanth, asked me about two of the points in the grammar criterion for band 8 writing (both task 1 and 2):</p>
<ul>
<li>uses a wide range of structures</li>
<li>the majority of sentences are error-free</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Here's the problem with these two points:</strong><br>When you try to use a wide range of grammatical structures, you risk making more mistakes (errors). But to reduce the number of mistakes, you might have to simplify your sentences.</p>
<p><strong>So what should you do?</strong><br>My advice is this: Forget about the 'wide range of structures' point. If all of your focus is on using complex grammar, you'll probably do something worse than just make mistakes; you'll probably forget to answer the question properly. The people who worry most about grammar usually neglect <em>task response</em>, <em>coherence</em> and <em>vocabulary</em>.</p>
<p>For me, grammar is the least important criterion to worry about. I tell students to focus on the other 75% of the scoring system: task response, coherence and vocabulary. However, if you want my tip for improving your grammar score, I'd say that it's better to focus on reducing errors. I think examiners notice errors more than they notice grammatical range, and if you write a mix of short and long sentences, you'll probably fulfil the 'wide range of structures' requirement without realising it.</p>

	<p>
				<p>I often meet students who have no problem getting band 7 for listening, reading and speaking, but they get a lower score in the writing test. Why is this?</p>
<p>These seem to be the main reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>They start writing without stopping to think first.</li>
<li>Their essays lack organisation because they didn't do a plan.</li>
<li>They don't develop their ideas in enough detail or depth.</li>
</ul>
<p>The solution is to spend more time planning and organising your ideas before you start writing. Think and plan before you write!</p>

	<p>
				<p>Students often ask me questions like: "Can you explain phrasal verbs?" or "Can you explain prepositions?"</p>
<p>The problem is that the word&nbsp;<em><strong>explain</strong></em> implies that phrasal verbs and prepositions are grammar issues with easy rules. In fact, there are no easy rules to explain phrasal verbs, prepositions, and many other areas of language. Instead of treating these things as 'grammar', it's easier to see them as vocabulary items.</p>
<p>In any language, some things can be explained using grammar rules. Everything else is vocabulary. You don't need to <em><strong>explain</strong></em> vocabulary; you just need to learn it gradually.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> vocabulary knowledge is the key to a high IELTS score!</p>

<p><strong>1. Do you like parks? Why / why not?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I like parks because they're great places to relax or go for a walk. I think every city needs some green space where people can escape from the crowds.</p>
<p><strong>2. How often do you visit parks?</strong></p>
<p>There's a park very close to where I live, so I probably go there once or twice a week if the weather's nice.</p>
<p><strong>3. Why are parks an important part of many towns and cities?</strong></p>
<p>Parks are like an oasis where people get away from the hustle and bustle of city life. They are where people go to have lunch, to take some exercise, or to forget about work for a while.</p>
<p><strong>4. What do you think could be done to make parks better?</strong></p>
<p>The parks in big cities are already really good in my opinion. If I think about the famous parks in London, Paris or New York, I can't imagine what I would do to improve them.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here are my sample answers for the part 3 'community' topic:</p>
<p><strong>1) What are some of the ways people can help others in the community? Which is the most important?</strong></p>
<p>I think there are many ways to help others in our local communities. For example, where I live, some people volunteer to run activity clubs for children, or they help out in residential homes for elderly people. Others give money, food or clothes to organisations that support people living below the poverty line. In my opinion, there isn’t a scale of importance when it comes to helping others; all forms of help are positive.</p>
<p><strong>2) Why do you think some people like to help other people?</strong></p>
<p>Most people get a good feeling when they help others, and they understand that we can all experience difficult times in our lives when we might need support. For example, we all grow old, and we all run the risk of losing our jobs or having a health problem that affects our ability to look after ourselves. So, I think people help others because they empathise with them.</p>
<p><strong>3) Some people say that people help others in the community more now than they did in the past. Do you agree or disagree? Why?</strong></p>
<p>I disagree with that kind of opinion. It’s impossible to generalise about how much people help in their communities from one generation to the next, so I don’t think we should try to judge or compare how altruistic people are now or were in the past. There have always been those who help others and those who don’t.</p>

<ul>
<li>As a child I enjoyed playing chess. I think chess is probably the best known board game in the world. It’s a game for two players, and the aim is to defeat the other player by taking his or her pieces and eventually trapping his King. This final move is called checkmate.</li>
<li>I remember that it was a classmate of mine at primary school who first taught me to play chess. He had a small, portable chess set, and once I knew how each piece moved, we started playing at break and lunch times; we played in our classroom or outside on the school playground. Later my parents bought me my own chess set as a birthday present so that I could play at home.</li>
<li>I taught my younger brother to play, and at some point I joined the school chess club. There I had the chance to hone my skills against some of the older pupils, and in my final year of primary school I made it onto the school team. There were five of us on the team, and we competed against children from other primary schools in the same town.</li>
<li>I liked playing chess because I enjoyed the challenge of thinking ahead and trying to outwit my opponent. I was probably seven or eight years old when I started playing, and it seemed like a very mysterious and intellectual game at that time. Also, although I loved winning, chess taught me to learn from my losses and to congratulate the person who had beaten me.</li>

				<p>Let's look at some of the vocabulary from Friday's <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2014/10/ielts-speaking-part-1-sample-answers.html" target="_self" title="">speaking lesson</a>, and some interesting alternatives. The alternatives on the right are a bit less common, and might impress the examiner if you used them.</p>
<ol>
<li><em><strong>with three bedrooms</strong></em> = a three-bedroomed house</li>
<li><em><strong>in a suburb of Manchester</strong></em> = on the outskirts of Manchester</li>
<li><em><strong>relax</strong></em> = unwind, put my feet up, wind down</li>
<li><em><strong>it needs a new kitchen</strong></em> = it could do with a new kitchen</li>
</ol>
<p>Note:<br>"could do with" is an informal way of saying "need" e.g. I could do with a drink, I could do with some help, I could do with another few days to finish this project.</p>

				<p>Did you notice that I used several conditional sentences in yesterday's speaking lesson? Here they are again:</p>
<ul>
<li>But if I had to choose, I'd say the living room...</li>
<li>...so that's what I'd change first.</li>
<li>I'd definitely move again at some point if I could afford to.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that I use <em><strong>I'd</strong></em> instead of the full <em><strong>I would</strong></em> because these are spoken answers (although it's fine to say <em><strong>I would</strong></em>).</p>
<p>Notice also that the 'if' conditional clause is missing from the second example. Sometimes we miss the condition because it is understood from the context. We understand from the context that I mean: "If I redecorated my home, that's what I would change first".</p>

				<p>Remember to keep your part 1 answers short and direct; the examiner will interrupt you if you don't. Here are my sample answers to the 'house or apartment' questions from two weeks ago:</p>
<p><strong>1. Do you live in a house or an apartment?</strong></p>
<p>I live in a semi-detached house with three bedrooms in a suburb of Manchester. I've lived there for just over a year.</p>
<p><strong>2. Which is your favourite room in your home? Why?</strong></p>
<p>I don't really have a favourite room. But if I had to choose, I'd say the living room because that's where I go to sit and relax.</p>
<p><strong>3. Would you change anything about your home? Why / why not?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I've been meaning to redecorate it since I moved in last year. It needs a new kitchen, so that's what I'd change first.</p>
<p><strong>4. Would you like to move to a different home in the future?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I'd definitely move again at some point if I could afford to. I'd like to live in the countryside, or maybe in a different city or country.</p>

	<p>
				<p>In yesterday's lesson I suggested that the sign of an advanced learner of English is the ability to express the same thing in different ways. But how can you get better at doing this?</p>
<p><strong>Here's a simple exercise:</strong><br>Imagine that you have to explain a word, phrase or idea to somebody who doesn't understand it. You have to explain it in as many different ways as you can, until you are sure that the other person understands.</p>
<p>Let's try this with the word 'paraphrasing'. Can you explain the concept of paraphrasing in a variety of different ways to someone who doesn't know what it means?</p>

	<p>
				<p>English students at beginner level learn to say "How are you?", but they probably don't know any other ways to say this. For example:</p>
<p>- How (are) you doing?<br>- How's life?<br>- How's it going?<br>- How are things? / How's things (with you)?<br>- What's up?<br>- How's tricks?<br>- How's everything going?<br>- Alright?</p>
<p>As a native speaker, I could keep going and add several more phrases to this list. The same happens in IELTS contexts: <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2014/09/ielts-writing-task-1-variety.html" target="_self" title="">click here</a> to see an example.</p>

				<p>Many students are overly worried about the examiner. They worry about body language, eye contact, how friendly the examiner is, whether the examiner smiles, whether he/she is making notes, what his/her opinion might be etc.</p>
<p>This kind of worrying is a waste of time and energy. My advice is that you should only worry about 2 things in the speaking test: 1) listening carefully to the questions 2) trying your best to give good answers. It's a language exam, so let's worry about language.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Have you tried using Google (or another search engine) to resolve grammar problems? For example, students asked me to explain the following sentences from the <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2014/09/ielts-writing-task-2-happiness-essay.html" target="_self" title="">essay</a> in Wednesday's lesson:</p>

<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">There do seem to be</span> some common needs that we all share.</li>
<li>It is no doubt true that...</li>
</ol>
<p>If we put quotation marks ("...") around the key words, and Google them, we can look for patterns in the search results that help us to understand the grammar.</p>
<p><em><strong>Example:</strong></em><br>Try searching for "preconditions to achieving", then try "preconditions to being" and "preconditions to doing". The search results should show you that "preconditions to +ing" is a normal grammar pattern in English.</p>
<p>Now search for "there do seem to be" and "it is no doubt true that". You might find that searching for grammar patterns is more useful than learning grammar rules.</p>

				<p>Here are my sample answers for the 'advice' questions from <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2014/07/ielts-speaking-part-3-advice-topic.html" target="_self" title="">this</a> lesson:</p>
<p><em><strong>1. Is it better to get advice from a friend or from a family member?</strong></em></p>
<p>I think it depends on the kind of advice that you need. Parents and grandparents probably have more life experience than a friend, and so you might get a wiser or more sensible answer from them. On the other hand, friends are less likely to become too worried if you go to them with a problem. For example, I probably wouldn’t want to burden my parents with a financial problem.</p>
<p><em><strong>2. What would you say are the characteristics of a good adviser?</strong></em></p>
<p>Well, firstly, a good adviser should be a good listener, someone who takes the time to understand the situation before offering advice. Secondly, an adviser should try to be objective, and avoid judging the person who is seeking help. Finally, I think the best advisers have the ability to ask the right questions and encourage others to find their own answers.</p>
<p><em><strong>3. Should people make their own work and career decisions, or is it a good idea to ask for advice about this?</strong></em></p>
<p>I’d say that it’s a mixture of both things. Most of us talk to family, friends, teachers or colleagues before we make career choices. However, I believe that the final decision should rest with the individual; we all need to take ultimate responsibility for the big life choices that we make.</p>

				<p>Most students use a dictionary to find the meanings of words. However, this is not enough; you also need to know how to use words correctly or accurately.</p>

<ul>
<li>Many people <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">blame</span> politicians <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">for</span> the economic crisis. (verb)</li>
<li>Politicians have <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">taken the blame for</span> the economic crisis. (take + noun)</li>
<li>Other people <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">put the blame for</span> this problem <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">on</span> the banks. (put + noun)</li>
<li>They think the banks <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">are to blame for</span> the crisis. (phrase: is/are to blame)</li>

<ul>
<li>I’m going to talk about my primary school. The school was called ..... and it was in the town of ..... . The location of the school was great because it was within walking distance of our family home at the time. The route to school was all downhill, which made it an easy walk in the morning, but a tiring journey on the way home in the afternoon!</li>
<li>I was a pupil at ..... school between the ages of 5 and 11 - the full 6 years of primary education. From age 11 onwards, I went to a nearby secondary school.</li>
<li>My primary school seemed like a big place at the time, but it was actually quite a small school, with only six classes. I remember there being a large room called the assembly hall, where the whole school gathered every morning to hear messages from the headmaster. I also remember spending a lot of time on the playground and on the sports field. I liked all of my teachers; they were caring but strict at the same time, and I think they fostered a positive and fun atmosphere in the school.</li>
<li>I have really fond memories of my primary school years, mainly because of the friends I made and the fun I had. One of my most vivid memories is of performing in the school play in my final year. I had to learn lines and play the part of a character in a traditional children’s story. It was a nerve-racking experience, but it felt like my first real achievement.</li>

<p>But someone asked this sensible question:</p>
<p><em>How can we get a high score for lexical resource (vocabulary) if we only use common words like 'increase', 'rise' and 'fall'?</em></p>

				<p>I posted this advice back in 2011, but I thought I would post it again today for people who haven't seen it. The first diagram below illustrates the idea that hard work is the only path to IELTS success:</p>

	<p>
				<p>If you're preparing for a writing or speaking topic, I recommend doing an Internet search for ideas first.</p>
<p>To find ideas for yesterday's speaking questions, I typed the phrase "what makes a good adviser" into Google, and found <a href="http://www.ehow.com/info_8533167_qualities-good-adviser.html" target="_self" title="">this webpage</a>. Look at some of the great language that we can steal from it:</p>
<ul>
<li>turning to an adviser</li>
<li>a wise choice</li>
<li>make decisions with more confidence</li>
<li>the decision requires expertise</li>
<li>use knowledge and experience</li>
<li>make an informed decision</li>
<li>some qualities are characteristic of good advisers</li>
<li>trustworthy, someone you can trust</li>
<li>possesses a strong base of knowledge</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember: the key to high speaking and writing scores is good vocabulary, so topic research is a vital part of your IELTS preparation.</p>

<p>Well, I have to do a certain amount of reading as part of my job, but I probably read more for enjoyment. I pick up a newspaper most days, and I usually have a book on the go.</p>

<ul>
<li>I’m going to describe my sister’s wedding day, which took place a few years ago in the town where I grew up. For my sister it was the biggest and most important day of her life.</li>
<li>I think there were around 100 people at the marriage ceremony, which was held in a church. Even more people came to the party, or the wedding reception as we call it, after the ceremony. Of course, most members of my family were there, as well as the groom’s family and a collection of the bride and groom's friends and colleagues.</li>
<li>To make the celebration special, we did what families normally do. My mother made sure that the church and the reception venue were nicely decorated - there were flowers everywhere! Obviously we all dressed for the occasion, and there were bridesmaids, gifts, a huge wedding cake, and so on.</li>
<li>I enjoyed the occasion because it was great to see my sister so happy on her big day. The ceremony was perfect, and we all had a fantastic time at the reception. It’s rare for me to see all of my family and friends together in one place, so that’s probably what made the day so memorable for me.</li>

				<p>Here are my answers to the questions in last week's lesson.</p>
<p><em><strong>1) Do you think that it's important for people to go on holiday?</strong></em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Answer using 'idea, explain, example'</span><br>Yes, I think we all need to go on holiday at least once or twice a year. It isn’t healthy to work all year round without some time off to relax; we all need to take a break and recharge our batteries from time to time. Last summer, for example, I went on holiday to France for a couple of weeks, and it was great to leave all of my usual responsibilities behind me. I came home feeling really refreshed and reinvigorated.</p>
<p><em><strong>2) Why do you think some people prefer not to go abroad on holiday?</strong></em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Answer using 'firstly, secondly, finally'</span><br>I suppose there are different reasons why some people choose not to go abroad on holidays. Firstly, it’s usually more expensive to travel abroad than it is to stay at home. A second reason could be that some people find it stressful to spend time in a foreign country where they don’t speak the language, or where they feel that they can’t easily integrate with the locals. Finally, many people just love where they live, and don’t feel the need to travel abroad.</p>

	<p>
				<p>A lot of people ask me what they should do to improve their scores. Generally speaking, there are only two things that you can do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Work on your exam technique</li>
<li>Work on your English</li>
</ol>
<p>I can often help students to make fast improvements by teaching them how to organise their essays, how to look for keywords in the reading test, or how to expand their answers in the speaking test. These are exam techniques.</p>
<p>However, exam techniques alone will not get you a band 7. You need a good level of English to get a 7, and that means you need to do the hard work it takes to gradually learn more words and phrases, improve your speaking fluency, and generally become a more confident user of the language.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em><br>Point 2 takes time. Don't expect your English to improve from 5.5 to 7 without a lot of work!</p>

				<p>Many students want to know how long it will take to get the score they need. It's impossible for me to answer this question because it depends on too many things. For example:</p>
<p>- How many hours of study do you do each day?<br>- What kind of study do you do?<br>- Do you have a teacher or someone who can help you?<br>- Do you live in an English-speaking country?<br>- Do you like learning English, or do you just need an IELTS score?</p>
<p>Maybe the last question is the most important one. In my experience, people who enjoy learning English tend to make the fastest progress.</p>

<ul>
<li>I’m going to describe the first time I visited England’s capital city, London, on a school trip when I was a teenager. I had never been to London before, and it was great to share that experience with my school friends.</li>
<li>The positive experience wasn’t confined to one particular place in London. As far as I remember, I enjoyed the whole trip, from the coach journey to the visits to various tourist attractions. We got off the coach near the Houses of Parliament, and so one of my first memories was seeing the famous ‘Big Ben’ clock tower. We also visited the Tower of London, Buckingham Palace and Trafalgar Square.</li>
<li>As I said earlier, it was a school trip, and I think there were around thirty of us, including two teachers. I was with a group of close friends, which made the experience more enjoyable.</li>
<li>What really struck me about London was that it was historic but modern and thriving at the same time. It seemed to me to be a lively, fashionable and cosmopolitan place. Coming from a relatively small town, the experience made me keen to visit more capital cities in the future.</li>

	<p>
				<p>Can you write an error-free sentence? How about an error-free paragraph?</p>
<p>If you want to get a band 7 or higher for IELTS writing, the examiner needs to see that you "regularly write error-free sentences". This means that several of the sentences in your essays should contain <em><strong>no</strong></em> mistakes.</p>
<p>The best way to improve your grammatical accuracy is by learning from your mistakes. Try to find a teacher or native speaker who can check your work and highlight the errors. Then make sure you understand the mistakes you made, and try to avoid making them again. Aim to write more error-free sentences each time you write an essay.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Memorising can be a good strategy for speaking part 2 because the same topics are often repeated. <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2012/09/ielts-speaking-part-2-main-topics.html" target="_self" title="">Click here</a> to see the six main topic areas that I tell my students to prepare first.</p>
<p>But memorising can be a risky strategy unless you are able to <em><strong>adapt</strong></em> your answers to the specific question. For example, if you prepared a description of a holiday, would you be able to adapt it for <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2014/05/ielts-speaking-part-2-teenager-topic.html" target="_self" title="">this question</a> about a positive experience you had as a teenager?</p>

<p><em>I am so excited to tell you that I finally got 7.0 in writing! Additionally I got overall 8.0 which is my personal best score ever.

<p>Please remember that the IELTS exam is a test for non-native speakers of English, not professional English writers. It's much easier than some people think to write a good IELTS essay. Don't try to use strange or 'difficult' language; just keep it clear and simple, and try to develop your ideas so that you fully answer the question.</p>

	<p>
				<p><strong>1. In your country, how do people treat visitors from abroad?</strong></p>
<p>I think we treat visitors well. People in the UK are very open-minded and welcoming, and we enjoy the mix of cultures that immigration and tourism bring. Most UK cities, for example, are really cosmopolitan, and you can meet visitors from every part of the world.</p>
<p><strong>2. Do you think hospitality towards visitors is less important than it was in the past?</strong></p>
<p>In my city, maybe it’s true that hospitality is less important nowadays, but that’s only because we are so used to seeing visitors from different countries, so we treat it as a normal part of life and nothing too special.</p>
<p><strong>3. What are the advantages of staying with a friend compared to staying in a hotel when visiting a foreign country?</strong></p>
<p>If you stay with a friend, you benefit from someone with local knowledge of the best places to visit. You can also get to know the character and customs of the local people, and for me, this is one of the most interesting aspects of a visit to another country. On the other hand, if you stay in a hotel, you are forced to discover the new place on your own, so it’s more of an adventure.</p>

				<p>Here's the question we've been looking at in recent weeks:</p>
<p><em><strong>Describe a subject that you think should be removed from school education programmes. You should say</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>- what the subject is</strong></em><br><em><strong>- why you think it is unnecessary for children to study it</strong></em><br><em><strong>- and explain what you would replace it with.</strong></em></p>
<p>Here's my sample answer with band 7-9 vocabulary underlined:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m going to suggest that art could be taken out of the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">school curriculum</span>. In my experience, art lessons at school tend to include drawing, painting, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the making of collages</span> using paper, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">fabric and other household materials</span>.</li>
<li>There are a few reasons why I think that school art lessons are unnecessary. Firstly, I don’t believe that drawing and painting are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">essential skills</span> that children will need when they leave school. Children might find these activities enjoyable, but <span style="text-decoration: underline;">it’s unlikely that</span> they will need them <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in the working world</span>. Secondly, children can draw, paint and make collages <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in their own time</span> at home; parents can encourage this, and they can even join in. Finally, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">remembering my own art lessons</span> at school, I don’t think we learnt any real art skills; the teachers left us to draw or create things, but they <span style="text-decoration: underline;">didn’t provide much technical instruction</span>.</li>
<li>Instead of art lessons, children could do more work on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">core subjects</span> like maths, science or language. These subjects are more likely to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">help children in later life</span> when they <span style="text-decoration: underline;">enter the job market</span>, and I think both children and their teachers would benefit <span style="text-decoration: underline;">if more time were devoted to them</span>.</li>

<p><strong>Question:</strong><br>In your opinion, are newspapers important?</p>
<p><strong>Example student answer:</strong><br>Yes, in my opinion newspapers are very important <em><strong>(why?)</strong></em> because they give us information about what is happening around the world. <em><strong>(why?)</strong></em> They are a vital source of knowledge about education, technology, medicine and many other fields.</p>

<p><strong>Example answer with 'alternative' and 'example':</strong><br>Yes, in my opinion newspapers are very important <em><strong>(why?)</strong></em> because they give us information about what is happening around the world. <em><strong>(why?)</strong></em> They are a vital source of knowledge about education, technology, medicine and many other fields. <em><strong>(alternative?)</strong></em> If newspapers didn’t exist, I think the quality of news coverage would suffer because there would be fewer professional journalists. <em><strong>(example?)</strong></em> We would have to rely, for example, on unpaid bloggers who do not have the budgets to carry out detailed research before they write an article.</p>

	<p>
				<p>One of the most common questions that people ask me is: "How can I improve my score from 6.5 to 7?"</p>
<p>Here's some advice if your current score is 6.5:</p>
<ul>
<li>The good news is that you are not doing anything wrong in terms of exam technique. The fact that you are getting 6.5 means that you are doing the exam in the right way.</li>
<li>You are very close to getting a 7. In the writing and speaking tests, a score of 6.5 means that you are already achieving band 7 in half of the requirements.</li>
<li>You don't need a special technique or piece of advice. You only need to make <em><strong>small improvements</strong></em>. For example, in the speaking and writing tests, try to express your ideas in a bit more detail, and try to reduce the number of small mistakes that you make.</li>

	<p>
				<p>You can often use 'old' ideas from a topic that you have already prepared to answer a new question. Take this question for example:</p>

<p>If you have, my advice is to do them again! This time, don't use the books for testing.

There is so much that you can learn from past exam papers.</p>

				<p>Candidates who get higher IELTS scores tend to use a wider range of vocabulary. A quick way to test your 'vocabulary range' is to challenge yourself to explain something in as many different ways as possible.</p>

<p><strong>Short answer:</strong><br>doing things that you enjoy</p>
<p><strong>Longer answer showing a wider vocabulary range:</strong><br>doing things that you enjoy; activities for fun or pleasure; leisure activities; what you do in your free time outside work; maybe pastimes or hobbies; it could include sports, games, or just relaxing and unwinding when you have time to yourself...</p>

<li>I’m going to talk about an interesting conversation that I had a couple of weeks ago in a music shop. I was walking along one of the main shopping streets in the city centre, when a large window displaying all sorts of musical instruments caught my eye. Out of curiosity, I decided to go in and have a look around.</li>
<li>The person I ended up speaking to was a shop assistant on the second floor, in the area of the shop dedicated to acoustic guitars. I hadn’t intended to speak to anyone, but the assistant approached me in a friendly way and asked whether I had any questions.</li>
<li>I explained to the assistant that I hadn’t played the guitar for years, but that I wondered what the differences were between the various acoustic guitars on show. He talked to me about the different makes and models, whether they were factory or hand made, the woods and varnishes used, the variation in sound quality, and of course the price range.</li>
<li>I found the conversation fascinating because the shop assistant was so knowledgeable. It was obvious that he had a passion for the guitar, and he didn’t mind talking to me even though I had made it clear that I didn’t intend to buy anything. He even picked up and played three or four of the instruments to demonstrate the differences in their sound.</li>

	<p>
				<p>Many students ask me about idioms: What are they? Should you use them? Do they help your score?</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Meaning</span><br>My dictionary defines an idiom as "a group of words whose meaning is not deducible from the meaning of each individual word". This means that you cannot understand an idiom by analysing it word for word. For example, "it's a piece of cake" means "it's easy". Phrasal verbs are also idiomatic expressions (e.g. "look up" can mean "search in a dictionary").</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Using idioms</span><br>English speakers use idioms all the time in conversation, but less so in formal/academic speaking and writing contexts. However, we often write things like "focus on an issue" or "the key to solving a problem" and here we are using 'focus' and 'key' in a figurative or idiomatic way.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Idioms in IELTS</span><br>You need to be really careful when using idioms in your IELTS test. Please don't learn lists of idioms; if you use them in the wrong way, your speech/writing will seem forced and unnatural. Also, remember that many idioms are informal or&nbsp;<a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2011/11/ielts-advice-avoid-proverbs-and-clichés.html" target="_self">clichéd</a>. So, what should you do? Read my tip below.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">My tip</span><br>You can only be sure that you are using an idiom correctly if you have seen or heard it used in context. For example, if you've read about someone who "set up a business", you can use that phrase with confidence (and it might help your score). If you've only seen the idiom on a list, don't use it.</p>

				<p>A few weeks ago I wrote an example answer about a <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2013/10/ielts-speaking-part-2-future-plans-answer.html" target="_self">future plan</a>.

<p><strong>Good vocabulary:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>it has its limitations</li>
<li>the bride and groom and their guests celebrating</li>
<li>capture longer range photos</li>
<li>photos in darker conditions</li>
<li>capture a special occasion</li>
<li>higher quality images</li>
<li>depends on whether</li>
<li>I’ll achieve that goal by experimenting</li>
<li>learning as I go along</li>

<p><strong>Grammar and coherence:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Variety of tenses and verb forms: I'm going to talk about, I'm using, I've realised, I thought, I'll talk, I did notice, I'd like to, before making, I'll achieve... if I can... (conditional)</li>

	<p>
				<p>In part 3, the examiner often asks a question about the past and a question about the future. For example:</p>
<ol>
<li>Did people have more free time when your grandparents were young?</li>
<li>Do you think the hobbies people have will be different in the future?</li>
</ol>
<p>In the first answer, the examiner wants to hear some past tense verbs.
In the second answer, you will need to use a future tense:</p>
<ol>
<li>When my grandparents <span style="text-decoration: underline;">were</span> young, I think they <span style="text-decoration: underline;">had</span> less leisure time. They <span style="text-decoration: underline;">didn't</span> have the gadgets we use nowadays, so they probably <span style="text-decoration: underline;">spent</span> more time doing simple things. For example, nowadays we can cook meals in a microwave in less than 5 minutes, whereas in the past people <span style="text-decoration: underline;">had</span> to cook everything themselves.</li>
<li>No, I don't think hobbies <span style="text-decoration: underline;">will change</span> much in the future. I'm sure people <span style="text-decoration: underline;">will still play</span> games and sports. On the other hand, maybe the Internet is changing the way we spend our free time.

<p>Unfortunately I don't have time to do any sports or physical activities because of my work commitments. I'd like to find more time for regular exercise.</p>
<p><em><strong>2. Which sport or game would you like to be good at?</strong></em></p>
<p>I'd like to be good at tennis. It must be great to be able to hit the ball as hard as you can and watch it land exactly where you wanted it to.</p>
<p><em><strong>3. Do you prefer watching or playing sports?</strong></em></p>
<p>I don't watch much sport on TV and I'm not a big sports fan, so I think I would probably enjoy doing sports more than watching them.</p>

<p>Yes, I think that sport is really important for children. Sports and games teach children to play together and try their best.</p>

<ul>
<li>I’m going to talk about a future plan that I have, which is to buy a good camera and to become a better photographer. At the moment I’m just using the camera on my mobile phone, but I’ve realised that it has its limitations.</li>
<li>I thought of this plan when I was at a friend’s wedding a few weeks ago. I got some great pictures of the bride and groom and their guests celebrating, but I did notice that with my phone camera I wasn’t able to capture longer range photos, or photos in darker conditions; the phone’s zoom and flash aren’t very good. Next time I’d like to be able to capture a special occasion in higher quality images.</li>
<li>Obviously this plan depends on whether I can save enough money to buy the camera I’d like. Also, before making a decision about which camera to get, I’ll probably talk to a friend who knows more about photography than I do.</li>
<li>In terms of buying a camera, I’ll achieve this plan if I can save some money! In terms of becoming a better photographer, I think I’ll achieve that goal by experimenting with my new camera and by learning as I go along.</li>

	<p>
				<p>Related to yesterday's lesson, here's a question that a student sent me last year:</p>
<p><em>Hi Simon, when you talk about Band 7+ vocabulary, you  always talk about two or three words (a phrase basically).   But I am trying to learn few "heavy" words like cardinal, multitudinous,  prodigious, prestidigitation, peregrination etc.  Can you please tell us what is more important for  IELTS: "heavy words" or good phrases?</em></p>
<p>My answer to this question is simple: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">good phrases</span> are much more important. The words listed by the student above would seem forced and unnatural, whereas good phrases show your ability to use words together like a native speaker would.</p>
<p>Please don't learn the "heavy" words mentioned by the student. Instead, focus on learning good <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2012/10/ielts-writing-task-2-collocations.html" target="_self">collocations</a> for IELTS topics.</p>

	<p>
				<p>I ban my students from using certain words in the IELTS test. The easiest way for me to explain why I ban these words is that most native speakers wouldn't use them if they were doing the test. Here are a few of my least favourites:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Moreover</strong> - Native speakers hardly ever use this word, and students tend to use it wrongly. Just use 'furthermore' or 'also'.</li>
<li><strong>Demerits</strong> - It's ok to talk about the 'merits' of something, but the word 'demerits' seems unnatural. Just use 'disadvantages' or 'drawbacks'.</li>
<li><strong>Hence / Thusly</strong> - These words sound too formal and old-fashioned. Just use 'therefore' or 'as a result'.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember that <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2011/07/ielts-advice-topic-vocabulary-is-the-key.html" target="_self">topic vocabulary</a> is the key to a high score, not 'difficult' words.</p>

<p>Here's my sample answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>My favourite season in England is winter. A typical English winter would last around 4 or 5 months between November and March, but when I say that I like the winter, I’m really thinking about the coldest month or two each year.</li>
<li>During those really wintry months, the temperature drops below zero and it often snows. Over the last few years we’ve had periods of quite heavy snowfall, to the extent that roads have been blocked and schools have had to close. Last winter I remember looking out of the window one morning and seeing everything covered in a layer of white.</li>
<li>Obviously the snow is what differentiates winter from the other seasons, but when it doesn’t snow there isn’t much difference between winter, autumn and spring; winter is just a bit colder.</li>
<li>The reason I’ve chosen winter as my favourite season is because I like the snow. I live near the countryside, and the landscape looks beautiful when everything is covered in white. We also celebrate Christmas and New Year in the winter, and these are my favourite festivals.</li>

<li>Study your teacher's corrections, and make sure you understand what you did wrong.</li>
<li>Pay special attention to any repeated mistakes that you make.</li>
<li>If you have a one-to-one teacher, you could also ask him or her to listen for mistakes that you make when speaking.</li>

<p><em><strong>2) What kind of shopping do you like doing?</strong></em></p>
<p>I quite like shopping for presents for people's birthdays or for Christmas. My favourite type of shop would have to be a bookshop.</p>
<p><em><strong>3) Is shopping a popular activity in your country?</strong></em></p>
<p>Yes, it's very popular. Saturday is the busiest shopping day, and lots of people treat shopping as a kind of leisure activity, rather than something practical.</p>
<p><em><strong>4) What types of shops do teenagers like best in your country?</strong></em></p>
<p>I'm not an expert on teenage behaviour, but I guess they like buying clothes, music, gadgets... that kind of thing.</p>

	<p>
				<p>In part 1 of the speaking test, the examiner will ask around 10 easy questions. However, students have reported some strange questions, such as:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do you like parks?</li>
<li>Do you think different colours can change our moods?</li>
<li>When do people give flowers in your country?</li>
</ol>
<p>Don't be shocked by these questions. Just give a simple answer with a reason. Don't worry about using fantastic grammar or vocabulary; just try to answer without hesitating. For example:</p>
<ol>
<li>Yes, I like parks because they are great places to relax. I think all cities need green areas.</li>
<li>Yes, I think bright colours, like red, can make you feel energetic. Some greens and blues can be more relaxing.</li>
<li>People give flowers on special occasions like birthdays or on Valentine's Day. In my country, giving flowers is seen as romantic.</li>

<p>I often compare learning a language to learning the piano. Nobody would expect to find a "secret" method to take them from intermediate to advanced on the piano - why do we expect language learning to be different?</p>

	<p>
				<p>A student asked me to explain which is better: 'a prime example' or 'a primary example'.</p>
<p>I would say 'a prime example'. Why? The answer is that 'prime example' is a normal collocation in English. It's the phrase that English speakers would use.</p>
<p>Native speakers instinctively know which words go together more commonly. They recognise groups of words like 'prime example'. This is what we mean by "collocation".</p>

	<p>
				<p>In part 3 of the speaking test, it's common to get questions about the past and future, as well as questions about 'now'. The examiner will be listening to your use of verb tenses:</p>
<p><em><strong>What types of transport <span style="text-decoration: underline;">are</span> there in your town?</strong></em></p>
<p>In Manchester I think you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">can find</span> every form of transport apart from an underground system. You <span style="text-decoration: underline;">can drive</span> around the city by car or get on a bus; there <span style="text-decoration: underline;">are</span> even free buses that take people between the train stations. Manchester also <span style="text-decoration: underline;">has</span> a tram system, and of course there <span style="text-decoration: underline;">are</span> taxis too.</p>
<p><em><strong>How <span style="text-decoration: underline;">has</span> transport <span style="text-decoration: underline;">changed</span> since your grandparents were young?</strong></em></p>
<p>Well, they <span style="text-decoration: underline;">had</span> cars, trains and planes back then, and London already <span style="text-decoration: underline;">had</span> the underground system, but I suppose the difference is that technology <span style="text-decoration: underline;">has moved</span> on. Having said that, the transport system <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is</span> not necessarily better nowadays; people <span style="text-decoration: underline;">travel</span> a lot more, and I'm sure we <span style="text-decoration: underline;">spend</span> more time stuck in traffic.</p>
<p><em><strong>What types of transport do you think we <span style="text-decoration: underline;">will use</span> in the future?</strong></em></p>
<p>I'm not sure, but hopefully <span style="text-decoration: underline;">we'll</span> have cars that drive themselves and never crash. I think <span style="text-decoration: underline;">we'll</span> probably fly more, and it <span style="text-decoration: underline;">might become</span> normal to have your own plane. On the other hand, many cities <span style="text-decoration: underline;">are building</span> more bicycle lanes, so maybe we <span style="text-decoration: underline;">will</span> use cars less for getting around towns and cities.</p>

	<p>
				<p>It's easy to read something (e.g. a lesson on this site) and think that you understand it. But 'understanding' is not the same as 'using'.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Can you really USE everything that you have read?<br>Can you use it correctly, without any mistakes?</strong></p>
<p>Look again at yesterday's lesson about 'lead to'. I'm sure you understand these words, but not many students are able to use them accurately. This is important because it could make the difference between a band 6 and a band 7.</p>
<p>Try to think about these steps when you are studying:</p>
<ol>
<li>Understanding a word is only the first step (e.g. 'lead to' means 'cause')</li>
<li>The next step is seeing how words are used (e.g. 'lead to + noun')</li>
<li>Try to use what you have learnt</li>
<li>Ask a teacher to correct your work</li>
<li>Learn from your mistakes</li>

<li>A competitive atmosphere in lessons leads to motivate students.</li>

<li>Tourism can lead to the destruction of natural habitats.</li>
<li>A competitive atmosphere in lessons motivates students.</li>

	<p>
				<p>When students are stuck on band 6.5 in writing, they often think that they need a new technique, a new book or some new advice. This is wrong!</p>
<p>If you have a 6.5, it means that you are already getting band 7 in 50% of the scoring criteria. For example, you might be getting 7 for task response and 7 for organisation, but 6 for vocabulary and 6 for grammar (examiners can't give half marks in these criteria). Just a small improvement in one area will take you to band 7 overall (e.g. 7,7,7,6 = band 7).</p>
<p>If you are getting band 6.5, your method is fine. Don't change what you're doing; just try to find a small improvement in one area.</p>

<p><em><strong>I tell my students to do the opposite: forget about these things!</strong></em></p>
<p>In my experience, the more you focus on grammar (25% of your score), the less you focus on answering the question well, organising your ideas, and using good vocabulary (75% of your score).

<p>Yes, of course. I loved playing with toys when I was a child; I think all children do.</p>
<p><em><strong>2) What kinds of toys did you like?</strong></em></p>
<p>As far as I remember, I mostly played with toy cars, planes and action figures from films or cartoons. I also liked building things with Lego.</p>

<p>Not really. I think boys like the kinds of toys that I mentioned before, whereas girls play with dolls. My niece, for example, doesn't like toy cars; she prefers dressing dolls in different outfits.</p>
<p><em><strong>4) Do you think that toys help children to learn?</strong></em></p>

<ul>
<li>I’m going to describe a street market that I’ve enjoyed visiting many times in Manchester. It’s the Manchester Christmas Market, and it comes to the city for about a month from the end of November every year. The market stalls are spread across several sites in the city centre, but the centrepiece is the large European market in Albert Square next to the Town Hall.</li>
<li>The Christmas Market stalls sell an array of Christmas gifts and mouth-watering food and drink from all over Europe. It’s a great place to find handmade crafts such as jewellery, ornaments, wooden toys and other souvenirs, but it’s the food and drink that seem to be most popular. Probably the biggest seller is the ‘Gluhwein’, a hot, sweet wine which is sold in a souvenir mug.</li>
<li>The market was originally quite small, occupying just one of the central squares in Manchester, but it’s grown quickly in recent years, spilling over into maybe five other pedestrian streets and a few other squares. Apparently there are over 200 stalls now, so it’s become a really big event attracting thousands of visitors.</li>
<li>The main reason I’ve always enjoyed visiting the Christmas Market is the fantastic atmosphere. When I went there last December, it didn’t matter how cold or wet the weather was, Manchester seemed to come alive when the market opened; the streets were bustling with people and there was a real festive feel to the city.</li>

	<p>
				<p>Is it acceptable to use memorised phrases in the writing and speaking tests? Well, it depends. Take the sentence below as an example. A student asked me whether it can be used at the beginning of a letter (general writing task 1).</p>
<p><em><strong>I hope this letter ﬁnds you well. Sorry I didn't write to you earlier, but I’ve been working ﬂat out since the moment I arrived home.</strong></em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Good use:</span><br>If the question tells you to begin by explaining to your friend why you haven't contacted him/her for a while, then this sentence would be perfect.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bad use:</span><br>However, if the question does <em><strong>not</strong></em> tell you to explain why you didn't write earlier, the sentence is <em><strong>irrelevant</strong></em>. It will be clear to the examiner that you have used that phrase because it looks good, and not because it fits the question.</p>
<p>Can you see the difference? The examiner will only be impressed if your memorised phrases fit the question perfectly.</p>

	<p>
				<p>In part 3 of IELTS speaking, it really helps if you give personal examples:</p>
<p><strong>1. Do you think it's important for people to have hobbies? Why?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I think people need to have hobbies because we all need to do things we enjoy in our spare time. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">In my case</span>, I find that playing football once a week with some friends helps me to relax, keep fit and forget about work. I think it's the same for everyone.</p>
<p><strong>2. Can hobbies have any negative effects?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, if you spend too much time on your hobby, it can affect other parts of your life. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I remember that</span> one of my friends spent most of his time at university playing computer games instead of studying. In the end, he failed most of his exams.</p>

	<p>
				<p>If you have the chance to take some lessons with a private teacher, here are some tips for writing and speaking:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask the teacher to identify your problem areas. Focus on improving those things first.</li>
<li>First, work together on 'big things' like overall essay structure, paragraphs or making sure you answer the question. Only work on 'small things' like grammar mistakes when you have perfected the big things.</li>
<li>Ask your teacher to write a full essay in front of you. Watch how she does it, and ask her to explain what she is thinking as she writes it.</li>
<li>Ask your teacher to mark your essays in front of you, and ask her to explain each correction.</li>
<li>When you practise questions for the speaking test, ask your teacher to play the part of the student. Record her answers and listen to them at home. Try to copy some of the phrases she used.</li>
<li>Practise doing speaking tests, and always ask the teacher for feedback: what did you do that was good, and how could you improve your answers?</li>
</ul>
<p>Private lessons might be more expensive, but they can be hugely beneficial if they are done in the right way.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Although this is a speaking test, a good way to prepare and practise is by writing your answers down. Here's a quick example:</p>
<p><em><strong>Describe a recent journey.</strong></em></p>
<p>I’m going to talk about a recent journey to London. It was a couple of weekends ago, and I decided to visit <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the capital</span> with some friends. I had never been before, so I wanted to go there to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">do some sightseeing</span>.&nbsp; I don’t have a car, but my friend does, so he <span style="text-decoration: underline;">volunteered to drive</span>. He had done the trip a few times before, so he knew the way. Maybe it was a bad idea to travel by car because the traffic between Manchester and London was terrible. We spent a lot of time <span style="text-decoration: underline;">sitting in traffic jams</span>, which were <span style="text-decoration: underline;">due to roadworks</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">minor accidents</span>, and it <span style="text-decoration: underline;">took us the best part of</span> an afternoon to get there...</p>

	<p>
				<p>Students often make mistakes when using these two phrases. To avoid mistakes, follow this simple advice:</p>
<p>- Use <em><strong>For example,</strong></em> at the start of a sentence.<br>- Use <em><strong>such as</strong></em> in the middle of a sentence.</p>
<p>Compare these examples:</p>

<li>Children should avoid eating junk food <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">such as</span> burgers and chips.</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice that 'For example' is followed by a comma and a full sentence. 'Such as' is in the middle of the sentence, followed by two nouns. You can use 'For instance' instead of 'For example'. You can use 'like' instead of 'such as'.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Many students do a lot of testing but not enough preparation. The problem with tests is that you don't learn anything new. You don't improve.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>"To train for a marathon, you don't run a full marathon every day!"</strong></em></p>
<p>The solution is to spend more time preparing. Don't test yourself on a new topic that you have no idea about. Spend some time researching the topic to find good ideas and vocabulary. Then try to write a 'perfect' essay using your research, a dictionary, your teacher to help you etc. Type the essay on a computer, check for spelling and grammar mistakes, re-read it, look at how the paragraphs are organised, highlight the 'band 7 vocabulary'. If I've covered the topic on this website, use my ideas to make 'perfect' paragraphs and ask a teacher to check them.</p>
<p>When you have written a 'perfect' essay, wait for a few days and <em>then test yourself</em> on that topic. Imagine the difference!</p>

<p><em><strong>1. How often do you make telephone calls?</strong></em></p>
<p>I probably make three or four phone calls every day, usually just to make arrangements with work colleagues or to speak to family and friends.</p>
<p><em><strong>2. Who do you spend most time talking to on the telephone?</strong></em></p>
<p>I think it would be one of my closest work colleagues. We often call each other rather than meeting face-to-face.</p>
<p><em><strong>3. When do you think you'll next make a telephone call?</strong></em></p>
<p>My family are expecting me to phone them as soon as I finish this exam. They'll want to know how it went.</p>
<p><em><strong>4. Do you sometimes prefer to send a text message instead of telephoning?</strong></em></p>
<p>Yes. I prefer to send a text message when I'm arranging something simple, like a time to meet someone. In those situations, a phone call isn't necessary.</p>

	<p>
				<p>When learning a language, grammar rules are useful because they show you how the language <em><strong>normally</strong></em> behaves. For example, you might learn that the word "to" is followed by the infinitive of the verb. The rule tells you that "to have" is correct and "to having" is wrong.</p>
<p>However, you should also be prepared to meet some exceptions to the grammar rules that you learn. For example, students are often confused by phrases like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?hl=en&amp;tab=ww#hl=en&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=%22look+forward+to+having%22&amp;oq=%22look+forward+to+having%22&amp;gs_l=hp.3..0l2j0i22i30l2.3191.10075.0.11539.24.24.0.0.0.1.449.2242.19j3j0j1j1.24.0...0.0...1c.1.12.psy-ab.tpFi40mLAuk&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.46340616,d.d2k&amp;fp=a6e63727a0ee5b33&amp;biw=1042&amp;bih=734" target="_self">'look forward to having'</a> or <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?hl=en&amp;tab=ww#hl=en&amp;output=search&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=%22advantages+to+having%22&amp;oq=%22advantages+to+having%22&amp;gs_l=hp.3..0l4.2452.11029.0.11441.22.22.0.0.0.0.97.1089.22.22.0...0.0...1c.1.12.psy-ab.2G3-3BSYbwk&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.46340616,d.d2k&amp;fp=a6e63727a0ee5b33&amp;biw=1042&amp;bih=734" target="_self">'advantages to having'</a>, both of which are correct.</p>
<p>When you find an exception to a grammar rule, don't get frustrated; consider it an opportunity to expand your knowledge of the language, and perhaps to impress the examiner!</p>

Maybe you read it and thought that it was too 'easy' to get a band 9. If you thought that, you would be wrong!</p>
<p>Here's why my description would get a band 9 (according to the IELTS criteria):</p>
<p><strong>1. Fluency and coherence</strong><br>The fact that I told a story made my answer really coherent (clear and logically organised). In terms of fluency, my description was written rather than spoken, so of course there are no pauses or hesitations.</p>
<p><strong>2. Lexical resource (vocabulary)</strong><br>The description might seem simple, but it isn't. A wide resource of vocabulary is used <span style="text-decoration: underline;">naturally</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">accurately</span>. There are definitely some 'less common' and idiomatic phrases (e.g. engrossed, the time passed, I suddenly realised, get going, my leg was dead, tipped over, to my surprise).</p>
<p><strong>3. Grammatical range and accuracy</strong><br>Unless you can find any mistakes, it would be difficult to give my description anything less than 9 for accuracy. The range of structures used is also easily good enough to impress the examiner.</p>
<p><strong>4. Pronunciation</strong><br>Hopefully this wouldn't be a problem as I'm a native speaker!</p>

<li>I was on my own so I decided to read the newspaper while drinking my coffee. I must have been quite engrossed in what I was reading because the time passed quickly, and I suddenly realised that I needed to get going. What I didn't realise was that I had been sitting with my legs crossed, and one of my legs had completely gone to sleep. As I stood up to leave the café, I quickly became aware that my left leg was 'dead', but it was too late; I started to fall. I thought I could catch myself on the table, but the table tipped over and I fell to the floor in front of everyone in the café!</li>
<li>I can remember being on my knees in the middle of the café, looking up at the staff and customers around me. I felt really embarrassed and I expected the other people to find it funny, but to my surprise nobody was laughing. They were all worried that something really bad had happened to me! As I got up from the floor, I had to explain to the whole café that I was fine. I was embarrassed at the time, but I laughed about it later!</li>

<p><em><strong>2. Do you usually see your friends during the week or at weekends?</strong></em></p>
<p>I tend to meet up with my friends at weekends because everyone's too busy during the week.</p>
<p><em><strong>3. The last time you saw your friends, what <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">did</span> you do together?</strong></em></p>
<p>It <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">was</span> one of my friends' birthday last weekend. Six of us <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">went</span> out for a meal to celebrate.</p>
<p><em><strong>4. In what ways are your friends important to you?</strong></em></p>
<p>I think it's important to have friends that you can talk to and share experiences with. My friends make me laugh, but I know I can also rely on them whenever I need help or support.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here are two more answers using the techniques I explained <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2013/03/ielts-speaking-part-3-longer-answers.html" target="_self">last week</a>:</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you think are the most important qualities for friends to have?</strong></em></p>
<p>Maybe the most important things are that friends need to share common interests and be honest with each other. <strong>(why?)</strong> Friends are people we spend a lot of time with, so it definitely helps if they enjoy doing the same activities or talking about the same topics as we do, and of course we need to be able to trust our friends, so honesty is vital for a good friendship. <strong>(alternatives / example?)</strong> I think I would struggle to become friends with someone who didn’t have anything in common with me, or who wasn’t reliable or trustworthy.</p>
<p><em><strong>How important do you think it is for a person to spend some time alone?</strong></em></p>
<p>I’d say that it’s essential to spend a bit of time alone, even if it’s just a few minutes a day. <strong>(why?)</strong> When you have a few minutes to yourself, it’s a chance to take stock and reflect on things. <strong>(why?)</strong> Most of us live such busy lives that our brains need time to catch up every now and then. <strong>(example / alternatives?)</strong> Personally, I try to have a bit of “me time” every day; I’ll go for a coffee or find a quiet place to sit and read the newspaper. If I never had any time alone, I think I’d go mad!</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here are 3 techniques to help you give longer, more detailed answers:</p>
<ol>
<li>Keep asking yourself "why?"</li>
<li>Explain the alternatives</li>
<li>Give an example</li>
</ol>
<p><em><strong>Question:</strong></em><br>Do you think that school children should be encouraged to have their own ideas, or is it more important for them to learn what their teachers give them?</p>
<p><em><strong>Answer:</strong></em><br>I think that we should definitely allow children to be creative and have their own ideas. <strong>(why?)</strong> Children need to develop the ability to think for themselves and solve problems <strong>(why?)</strong> because as adults they will not always have somebody to guide them or tell them what to do. <strong>(alternatives?) </strong>If we don't allow children to have their own ideas, they will be less successful in the adult world; they will be too reliant on others. <strong>(example?)</strong> A doctor, for example, might encounter a situation that he or she hasn't been trained for, but will still be expected to make a decision that could save someone's life.</p>

	<p>
				<p>To get a band 7, you <em><strong>don't</strong></em> need to learn "big" or "difficult" words. You need to learn how to use words <em><strong>together</strong></em>. You need to use good collocations.</p>
<p>Collocations are groups of words that often go together. For example, collocations like "increase significantly" are used in IELTS Writing Task 1.</p>
<p>Look for collocations in the speaking and writing lessons on this website. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Health topic:</strong> a major cause, poor health, manual jobs, physical activity, outdoor sports.</li>
<li><strong>Writing Task 1:</strong> noticeable feature, significantly higher, a dramatic increase in.</li>
<li><strong>Describe a person:</strong> a major influence, a good role model, inherit traits, set an example, a positive outlook.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most learner dictionaries now show examples of how words are used in common collocations and phrases. If you read a lot of English, you will see collocations everywhere.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Example answer (band 9):</span></p>
<p>I’d like to talk about a team project that I was involved in during my final term at business school. There were four of us on the team, and our task was to work with a local company to research a new market, in a European country, for one of their products or services. Our objective was to produce a report and give a presentation.</p>
<p>The first thing we did was split into two groups of two. We had been assigned a company that produced a range of bicycle accessories, so two of us spent some time getting to know the company while the other two researched the market and the competitors in the target country, which was Germany. In the end, I think it was a successful project because we managed to identify a possible gap in the market in Germany for one of the company’s products. Our group presentation also went really well.</p>
<p>Until that point, the course had been all about business theory, so it was quite a learning experience to work with a real company. I felt a real sense of accomplishment when we handed in our report and delivered our presentation, and I think all of us were proud of what we had done.</p>

				<p>To get a good IELTS score, you need to use the kind of language that native speakers might use. This doesn't mean 'difficult words', it means good groups of words (phrases and collocations).</p>
<p>When reading, try to look for phrases that English speakers use. Here's an example paragraph from the <a href="https://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2011/08/web-turns-twenty" target="_self">Economist Magazine</a> with a few useful words and phrases underlined.</p>
<p>It is always a little disconcerting to realise a generation has grown up never knowing what it was like to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">manage without something</span> that is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">taken for granted</span> today. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">A case in point</span>: the World Wide Web (WWW), which celebrated the 20th anniversary of its introduction last Saturday. It is no exaggeration to say that not since the invention of the printing press has a new media technology <span style="text-decoration: underline;">altered the way people think, work and play</span> quite so extensively.

<p>How has technology affected the kinds of music that young people listen to?</p>
<p><strong>My answer, using both tips above:</strong></p>
<p><strong>(1)</strong> To be honest I don't really know the answer to that because I'm completely out of touch with what young people are listening to, and I'm not a fan of pop music.<strong><br>(2)</strong> However, I suppose that technology must have affected music. Maybe young people are listening to music that has been made using computer software instead of real musical instruments like the piano or guitar.</p>

				<p>Question 4 in Monday's <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2013/02/ielts-reading-true-false-not-given.html" target="_self">reading lesson</a> caused some problems because many people fell into the trap of 'overthinking' the answer. They were worried about the precise meaning of the word "infants", and whether it meant the same thing as "pre-school age children".</p>
<p>In the reading test, you shouldn't worry about such precise distinctions. It's enough to recognise that both "infants" and "pre-school age children" are very young children. The answer would be 'false' if the question mentioned "teenagers" or "adolescents" - these are definitely not pre-school ages.</p>
<p>Remember that the people who write these questions rely on paraphrasing and synonyms; it wouldn't really test your English if every question contained the exact words from the passage. If the words have basically the same meaning, don't analyse them any further.</p>

<p><strong>Example answer:</strong><br>I don't think there <span style="text-decoration: underline;">will be</span> much change in terms of what houses look like from the outside. In this country, people still like traditional brick or stone houses. Having said that, the design of apartment blocks <span style="text-decoration: underline;">will probably continue</span> to develop, with more and more experimental or futuristic buildings made of glass and metal. I <span style="text-decoration: underline;">imagine that it will be</span> the insides of homes that change the most; houses <span style="text-decoration: underline;">will no doubt be</span> full of technological devices to make our lives easier. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Maybe we'll have</span> things like voice-controlled doors, lights and appliances.</p>

<p><strong>Part 2 - speak for 2 minutes</strong><br>Describe an interesting home that you have visited.</p>
<p><strong>Part 3 - give longer answers</strong><br>1. What factors do you think are important when choosing where to live?<br>2. Compare life in a city with life in the countryside.<br>3. How do you think the design of homes will change in the future?</p>

	<p>
				<p>For IELTS speaking part 1, remember to give short, simple answers. Answer the question with a full sentence and give a reason for your answer. Here are some example questions and answers about musical instruments (from Cambridge IELTS book 6):</p>
<p><em><strong>1. Which musical instrument do you like listening to most? (Why?)</strong></em></p>
<p>My favourite musical instrument to listen to is the guitar. I like the fact that there are different types of guitar, like classical, acoustic and electric. I love the variety of sounds a guitar can make.</p>
<p><em><strong>2. Have you ever learned to play a musical instrument?</strong></em></p>
<p>I took some guitar lessons when I was younger and still have a guitar at home. I don't play it much nowadays. I wish I had more time to practise.</p>
<p><em><strong>3. Do you think children should learn to play an instrument at school?</strong></em></p>
<p>Yes, I think it's a great skill and it's really enjoyable to be able to play a musical instrument. All children should be given this opportunity.</p>
<p><em><strong>4. How easy would it be to learn to play an instrument without a teacher?<br></strong></em></p>
<p>It would probably be more difficult without a teacher. You need someone to show you what to do and correct your mistakes. You need a lot of discipline to teach yourself.</p>

<p>However, those people often reach the point where they need some direct guidance. They need someone to check their essays or listen to them speak.</p>

<li>Try to develop each bullet point in detail. If you don't say enough for the first two or three points, you'll find yourself with too much time for the last point.</li>
<li>Tell a story! My second point tells the story of how I was given the chair by a friend, and I could probably speak for 2 minutes about this point alone. When you tell a story about something real that happened, you'll find it easy to keep talking. Stories are also interesting for the listener (the examiner).</li>
<li>Add examples. In point 3, you can see that I added an example at the end ("last night I fell asleep in my armchair while I was watching a film"). I could easily take this example and develop it into another short story.</li>
<li>When describing an object, don't forget the simple things like size, colour (I forgot that one!), shape, material, position ("just under my living room window").</li>

<li>I'm going to talk about my favourite chair. It's a big, leather armchair that sits in my living room at home, just under my living room window.</li>
<li>I didn't actually buy the armchair. One of my friends was moving house and was going to buy some new furniture. I had always liked his leather armchair, so he said I could have it if I managed to move it. The chair wouldn't fit in my car, and it was tricky to get it out of my friend's apartment. I had to hire a small van to take the armchair home.</li>
<li>Obviously I use the armchair for sitting! It's my favourite place in the house to relax, read a book, watch TV or even do some work; the chair's arms are quite wide and flat, so my laptop fits nicely on either of them. Last night I fell asleep in my armchair while I was watching a film.</li>
<li>The main reasons why I like this piece of furniture are that it's comfortable and it's in the perfect position in my living room. The only drawback might be that I enjoy sitting in the armchair too much, and sometimes I think it makes me lazy!</li>

<p>Well, I have to dress quite formally for work, so I wear a shirt and trousers. At home I prefer to wear jeans and a T-shirt, and on special occasions I might wear a suit.</p>
<p><strong><em>3. Do you wear different styles of clothes now compared to 10 years ago?</em></strong></p>
<p>No, not really, because I don't follow fashion. I think I have dressed in a similar way for the last 10 years.</p>
<p><strong><em>4. Do you think the clothes we wear say something about who we are?</em></strong></p>
<p>Yes, they probably do. Some people are really careful about what they wear because they want to be seen as stylish. Other people wear clothes that show wealth or status, such as clothes by famous designers.</p>

<p>When I studied foreign languages at school, we were mainly taught vocabulary as a list of individual words with a translation of their meanings. The problem with learning a list of individual words is that you don't learn how to use them in a natural way, and you find yourself translating word by word from your own language.</p>
<p>The alternative is to study phrases that native speakers have produced.

				<p>Questions in part 3 of the speaking test follow on from the topic you were given in part 2.

For example:</p>
<p><em><strong>1. What do you think we can learn by studying events of the past?</strong></em></p>
<p>I think we can learn a lot by studying history. Just as individual people learn from their mistakes, societies can learn from the mistakes made by previous governments or leaders. For example, from what I've read in the newspapers, many economists are looking back to the time of the Great Depression, around 80 years ago, in order to understand the financial crisis that is currently affecting many countries around the world. Even if we don't always learn from mistakes, I think it's fascinating to study history because it gives us an insight into who we are and where we come from.</p>
<p><em><strong>2. What important events do you think might take place in the future?</strong></em></p>
<p>It's really difficult to predict what will happen in the future; most of the big, historic events of the past would have been impossible to foresee. For example, I don't think that anyone living 100 years ago could have imagined that people would one day walk on the moon! If I had to guess what might happen in the future, I'd like to think that scientists will invent cures for diseases like cancer, and we'll all live longer.</p>

				<p>A student sent me this question from a recent IELTS test:</p>

<li><em><strong>what the event was</strong></em></li>
<li><em><strong>and what effect you think this event had.</strong></em></li>

<ul>
<li>Don't talk about a personal event - that would be considered 'off topic'.</li>
<li>Choose something that you know about - a recent event might be easier.

	<p>
				<p><em><strong>Describe an old building that you like. You should say:</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>where it is</strong></em></li>
<li><em><strong>what it is used for</strong></em></li>
<li><em><strong>and why you like it.</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p>The answer below is adapted from the <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2011/06/ielts-speaking-part-2-describe-a-building.html" target="_self">modern building</a> description I wrote last year. Can you spot some of the vocabulary that I've recycled?</p>
<ol>
<li>I'm going to describe a very famous building in New York: the Empire State Building. People might not think of it as an old building, but the Empire State Building was built in 1931, so I don't think it can be classed as new. It's located on Manhattan island and it's probably the most distinctive and recognisable building when you look at New York's skyline.</li>
<li>As far as I know, the Empire State Building is an office building, but visitors can go up to an observation deck on the top floor, which is the 102nd floor. There's also a 360-degree observation area on the 86th floor. Apparently, the building makes more money from the sale of tickets to the observation floors than it does from office rentals.</li>
<li>I think the Empire State Building is still one of the most impressive skyscrapers in the world. It's such an iconic structure, and it's amazing to think that it was built around 80 years ago. The best thing about the building is the viewing deck on the top floor, which offers spectacular views of the city; it's definitely the best vantage point in New York. I'd recommend anyone who visits the city to go there and experience the view.</li>

				<p>I've already done a description of a modern building <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2011/06/ielts-speaking-part-2-describe-a-building.html" target="_self">here</a>, but the examiner might ask you to describe an old building. How can we adapt the 'modern building' description?</p>
<p>Looking at the vocabulary I used to describe the modern building (famous landmark, spectacular views, best vantage point etc.), it seems that we should choose an old building which is tall or has great views of a city.</p>
<p>

One possibility that comes to mind is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_state_building" target="_self">Empire State Building</a> in New York. It was built in 1931, so I think that would be old enough.</p>
<p>

<p>Can you think of any other examples? If you choose a famous building, it will probably have its own Wikipedia page. Do some research, and plan your description.</p>

				<p>Students tend to worry about 'difficult questions', but questions are often much easier than they seem. For example:</p>
<p><em><strong>Describe a law in your country.</strong></em></p>
<p>Many students think they don't know anything about laws. However, there are some easy examples that they could choose:</p>
<ol>
<li>In many countries it is now illegal to use a mobile phone while driving. You could start by talking about the popularity and benefits of mobile phones, and explain that people want to be able to answer calls wherever they are. Then you could explain the dangers of being distracted while driving; this law could reduce the number of road accidents, and therefore save lives.</li>
<li>If you feel confident talking about the 'education' topic, you could choose the 'compulsory education' law. This is the legal requirement that children up to a certain age must attend school. In the UK, for example, children are required by law to continue in education until they are 16 years old. This is a good topic because you can talk about the benefits of education.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, you could choose a more obvious law (it is illegal to steal, carry a gun etc.) but you might have more ideas and good vocabulary if you choose a typical IELTS topic like number 2 above.</p>

<p>No, I don't like dancing. I'm not a big music fan, and dancing just makes me feel uncomfortable and self-conscious.</p>
<p><em><strong>2. Has anyone ever taught you to dance?</strong></em></p>
<p>No, I've never been interested in learning to dance, so I've never taken any lessons or asked anyone to show me how to do it.</p>

<li>Describe an object (a gift, something you use etc.)</li>
<li>Describe a person (someone you admire, a family member etc.)</li>
<li>Describe an event (a festival, celebration etc.)</li>

<li>Describe a place (somewhere you visited, a holiday etc.)</li>
<li>Describe your favourite (book/film/advertisement/website)</li>
</ol>
<p>Most questions fit into one of these topics. For example, <em><strong>"Describe a river, lake or sea which you like"</strong></em> is number 5 - you could describe a holiday by the sea, or a city with a river.</p>

				<p>Last week we looked at this question:</p>
<p><em><strong>Describe a TV programme or channel that you enjoy watching regularly. </strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>What it is called  and what is it about?</strong></em></li>
<li><em><strong>When do you usually watch it ?</strong></em></li>
<li><em><strong>Why do you prefer it to other programmes or channels?</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p>Here's a sample description with the best vocabulary underlined:</p>
<ul>
<li>I <span style="text-decoration: underline;">rarely</span> watch <span style="text-decoration: underline;">traditional television channels</span> nowadays; I <span style="text-decoration: underline;">much prefer</span> searching for interesting programmes or videos online. So, although it’s not a normal TV channel or programme, I’d like to talk about a website which I think is kind of a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">modern version</span> of a TV channel. It’s called TED, which <span style="text-decoration: underline;">stands for</span> ‘Technology, Entertainment, Design’, and it’s a great place to watch short talks and presentations about all sorts of interesting topics.</li>
<li>The good thing about the videos on TED is that I can watch them whenever I want. I have ted.com saved as one of my favourites on my laptop, and I <span style="text-decoration: underline;">tend to visit</span> the website every few days to check whether there is anything new. I often watch TED videos on my phone while I’m travelling to work on the train.</li>
<li>The reason I like watching online videos on TED is that I learn something new every time I watch one. The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">tagline</span> for the TED website is ‘ideas worth spreading’, and this really <span style="text-decoration: underline;">sums up the appeal</span> of the site for me. Instead of watching <span style="text-decoration: underline;">meaningless soap operas</span> and talk shows on TV, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I’d much rather</span> spend 10 minutes watching someone talk about a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">breakthrough in technology, science or healthcare</span>.</li>

				<p>Yap asked me about the following question:</p>
<p><em><strong>Describe a TV programme or channel that you enjoy watching regularly. </strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>What it is called  and what is it about?</strong></em></li>
<li><em><strong>When do you usually watch it ?</strong></em></li>
<li><em><strong>Why do you prefer it to other programmes or channels?</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p>Yap asked whether it would be acceptable to talk about <a href="https://www.ted.com/" target="_self">ted.com</a> as a TV channel. I think it would definitely be acceptable - just say that it's an online TV channel. TED would be a great choice for this topic.</p>

	<p>
				<p><em><strong>Describe a vehicle you would like to buy in the future. You should say</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>what kind of vehicle it is</strong></em></li>
<li><em><strong>what you would use it for</strong></em></li>
<li><em><strong>and why you would like to buy it.</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p>Here's my sample answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>If I had the money, I’d like to buy my own helicopter. I recently saw a TV programme about someone who flew around in his own helicopter, and I remember thinking that it would be great to have one. The helicopter on the programme was a small, blue, two-seater and it seemed quite easy to fly - that's the kind of thing I'd like to buy.</li>
<li>Ideally, I’d use my helicopter instead of a car. First, I’d need to learn to fly it, but then I’d use it to go on short trips or holidays. It would be fantastic to be able to avoid traffic jams, and get everywhere in a fraction of the time it normally takes. I’d take friends and family sightseeing, over cities or mountain tops, and maybe I could even use it to do the shopping!</li>
<li>The reason I’d like to buy a helicopter is that you can park one almost anywhere. You don’t need to find a runway or an airport like you would for a plane. So I’d be able to park my helicopter in my garden - if I had a bigger garden. Also, I’ve always been intrigued by those helipads on the tops of tall buildings - I think it would be fun to land on top of a building. A helicopter probably isn’t a realistic choice of vehicle, but you never know - I might win the lottery!</li>

</ul>
<p>Here's some advice (I'll give you my model answer next week):</p>
<ol>
<li>Make your decision quickly. Most people will choose to describe a car, but if you're feeling adventurous, it might be fun to choose an aeroplane (airplane) or a helicopter. It doesn't matter if your choice isn't realistic.</li>
<li>Develop each point in detail. For the first bullet point, tell the examiner as much as you can about the vehicle e.g. the make of the car, its colour, what it looks like outside and inside, the gadgets it has inside etc.</li>
<li>Stories are the best type of example: imagine where you would go in your new vehicle, and what you would use it for. The benefit of choosing something adventurous, like the aeroplane or helicopter, is that you are more likely to be creative and imaginative in the rest of your answer.</li>

	<p>
				<p>Here are some tips to help you feel more confident when you go for your IELTS speaking test:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be prepared: you should know exactly what to expect in the 3 parts of the speaking test, and you should have read the suggestions on this website about how to answer.</li>
<li>Lots of practice: a student who has practised answering all of the questions in all eight Cambridge books, as well as the questions on this site, will feel much more confident than a student who hasn't.</li>
<li>Write it down: when studying at home, you have time to prepare 'perfect' answers to practice questions; write your answers down, and ask someone to help you check and improve them.</li>
<li>Speak aloud: start by reading the answers you wrote down (like an actor uses a script), then gradually stop using the script.</li>
<li>Record yourself: this allows you to analyse the quality of your answers, as well as your pronunciation, vocabulary and grammar.</li>
<li>Focus on ideas: it's difficult to think about grammar when you are speaking, so I advise students to stop worrying about grammatical structures, and focus on expressing good ideas (which means good vocabulary).</li>

	<p>
				<p>I sometimes hear from students who are worried that their examiner seemed rude or angry in the speaking exam. Maybe the examiner didn't smile or make much eye contact, interrupted a lot, or kept looking at his/her watch. Does this mean that you will get a low score, or that you should complain?</p>
<p>The answer is no! Don't worry, and don't think that you need to complain. The examiner's attitude is not important at all, and you should ignore all of the things I mentioned above. Focus only on answering the examiner's questions as well as you can.</p>
<p>Remember: it's possible to have a very nice, smiling examiner who gives you a low score. On the other hand, an examiner who seems impolite or disinterested might give you a higher score than you expected!</p>

				<p>Many students worry too much about grammar. For speaking parts 2 and 3, it's more important to worry about the quality of your answers. The best way to improve the quality of your answers is by adding detail.</p>

<p><strong>Short answer about when we met:</strong><br>I met my best friend at school when I was 11 years old.</p>
<p><strong>Detailed answer about when we met:</strong><br>I met my best friend at school when I was 11 years old, so we've known each other for ... years. I remember we sat next to each other in my first science lesson at secondary school, and we had to work together to do an experiment. We got on straight away, and we've been friends ever since.</p>

	<p>
				<p>People often ask whether it's a good idea to ask for a re-mark of their tests. Here are a few tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't recommend asking for your reading or listening paper to be re-marked. Reading and listening questions are either right or wrong, so it's unlikely that your scores will change.</li>
<li>If there is a 2 band difference between your writing and speaking scores, they are usually double-checked automatically, so a re-mark probably won't help.</li>
<li>A re-mark might be worth trying if you only need an extra half band in speaking or writing (e.g. if you have 6.5 and need 7).</li>
<li>Remember that it can take up to 8 weeks to get your test re-marked. It might be faster to resit the test.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em><br>If you have had a test re-marked, please tell us what happened. It would be interesting to know how many people's scores went up.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Don't worry if you get a question that you haven't prepared for. You can usually use ideas that you prepared for a different topic. For example:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Describe a piece of advice that you gave (or that someone gave you)</strong></em></p>
<p>Why not say that you advised your friend to visit London?

	<p>
				<p>Two weeks ago I showed you a part 2 question about <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2012/06/ielts-speaking-part-2-choose-your-topic-quickly.html" target="_self">a situation in which you were polite</a>. Let's have a look at some related questions for part 3 of the test:</p>
<p><em><strong>In your country’s culture, how do you show that you are being polite?</strong></em></p>
<p>We really value politeness and good manners in the UK, and there are many types of polite behaviour. One of the first things we learn as children is to say "please" and "thank you". As adults, I think we are careful not to be too direct in the language we use. For example, we would never say "Bring me the bill" in a restaurant because this kind of direct instruction would sound rude. It would be much more polite to say "Could we have the bill, please?".</p>
<p><em><strong>Are we less polite with members of our families than with people we don’t know?</strong></em></p>
<p>I suppose it's normal to be a bit more relaxed about politeness with family members. Most people tend to speak in a more informal way at home; in the UK, we still say "please" and "thanks", but it's fine to use colloquial language and things like nicknames that you would never use with someone you didn't know.</p>

				<p>The secret to a high IELTS score is being able to understand and use a wide range of words and phrases. As I said on Monday, it's really important to collect vocabulary in a notebook, but you also need to practise using it.</p>

	<p>
				<p>In part 3 of IELTS speaking, you might be asked to compare the past with the present. The examiner will be listening to your use tenses. For example:</p>
<p><em><strong>Are there any differences between the types of people who were seen as celebrities in the past and those who are celebrities nowadays?</strong></em></p>
<p>Yes, I think there <span style="text-decoration: underline;">have been</span> some big changes in the types of people who <span style="text-decoration: underline;">become</span> famous<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>. In the past, before the invention of television, I suppose there <span style="text-decoration: underline;">were</span> very few national or international celebrities; maybe kings and queens, military, political and religious leaders <span style="text-decoration: underline;">were</span> the only household names. With the advent of TV and radio, performers such as actors and musicians <span style="text-decoration: underline;">became</span> more well-known. However, we now <span style="text-decoration: underline;">seem to have</span> a completely new breed of celebrity as a result of 'reality' television programmes; these are people who <span style="text-decoration: underline;">don't really have</span> any special skills as performers, but who <span style="text-decoration: underline;">are</span> famous for just being themselves.</p>

	<p>

<li><em><strong>how you showed that you were polite</strong></em></li>
<li><em><strong>and why you needed to be so polite.</strong></em></li>

<p><em><strong>Task:</strong></em><br>Give yourself just 10 seconds to choose your polite situation. It doesn't really matter what situation you choose; the key is to give yourself enough time to prepare some ideas.</p>

	<p>
				<p>In part 3 of the speaking test, you need to give longer, detailed answers. A good way to do this is by organising your answers according to the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Idea: answer the question directly.</li>
<li>Explain: give a reason or explain your answer in more detail.</li>
<li>Alternative: explain an alternative (e.g. the opposite) to your answer.</li>
<li>Example: give an example to support your answer.</li>
<li>Another idea: sometimes you think of another idea while you are speaking. Just add it on the end of your answer.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can give a really good answer without including all five steps, but you might find it useful to practise including all five, as I've done here:</p>
<p><em><strong>Why do you think some people prefer to buy products from their own countries rather than imported items?</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>(idea)</strong></em> I suppose it’s because those people want to support the economy of the country they live in. <em><strong>(explain)</strong></em> If they buy something that was made in their own country, they know that they are contributing to the salaries of workers within the same country, <em><strong>(alternative)</strong></em> whereas if they buy imported items, a foreign company and its employees will benefit. <em><strong>(example)</strong></em> For example, if I buy some meat that originates from a local farm rather than a farm in another country, I’m helping one of my fellow citizens to carry on in business. <em><strong>(another idea)</strong></em> Also, I think that trust is an issue; people might feel that they can trust domestically produced items more than imported ones.</p>

</ul>
<p><span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">So, are these 'formula phrases' a good idea? My answer is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>no</strong></em></span>!</span></p>
<p>As an English speaker and ex-examiner, I find these phrases annoying. It's obvious that they are memorised, and they do not address the question topic. Please don't expect the examiner to be impressed by this kind of thing.</p>
<p>There are a couple of benefits to learning a formula: it gives your answer some structure, and it might make you feel more confident during the test. However, the disadvantages are greater:</p>

<p>My answer to the above questions is <em><strong>no</strong></em>. If you write "ascend" or "portray" in writing task 1, it will seem strange to the examiner. Those words are not appropriate for a graph or chart description.</p>
<p>Remember: the aim of the IELTS test is <em><strong>not</strong></em> to find 'original' writers; it is to see whether you can express your ideas clearly, accurately, and in a certain amount of detail. These are the skills that you need for university or work. Leave the 'original' writing to novelists!</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here are some ideas for <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2012/05/ielts-speaking-part-2-foreign-culture-topic.html" target="_self">last week's question</a>.</p>
<p><strong>1. Which culture and how I know about it</strong><br>I'm going to talk about France and French culture. I know France quite well because it was the first foreign country that I visited as a child. I've been on several family holidays there, and I lived and worked in Paris for a while after finishing university.</p>
<p><strong>2. Cultural differences</strong><br>The first thing that comes to mind when I think about France is the bread! I love the fact that French people buy fresh baguettes every morning, usually from small local bakeries or 'patisseries'; it makes a change from the loaves of sliced bread that most of us buy from the supermarket here in the UK. One slightly negative difference I noticed in Paris is that Parisians don't seem to make friends with their work colleagues to the same extent as we do here.</p>
<p><strong>3. What I like about it</strong><br>I really like the café culture in France. You can always find somewhere interesting to sit and have a coffee and chat to friends or just watch the world go by. I actually put on a bit of weight when I lived in France because I got into a habit of having a croissant or a cake in every nice café that I found. Another thing I could mention is that the last time I went to France on holiday, I played a game called ‘boules’ every day. The game consists in throwing metal balls as close to a target ball as possible. It’s the perfect game for a relaxing afternoon when the weather’s hot.</p>
<p><em><strong>Tip:</strong></em><br>Notice that I included personal examples or experiences in my answers. It's easy to talk for 2 minutes if you can tell a story or two.</p>

	<p>
				<p><em><strong>Describe a foreign culture that you like. You should say</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>what culture it is and how you know about it</strong></em></li>
<li><em><strong>what differences there are between that culture and your own</strong></em></li>
<li><em><strong>and why you like that foreign culture.</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p>For this question, you don't need to discuss 'deep' cultural issues. Just choose a foreign country that you have visited, and talk about anything that is different from your own culture (language, food, customs, behaviour, typical activities etc.).</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here are some questions that I found on the official IELTS website, <a href="https://www.ielts.org/" target="_self">ielts.org</a>. The answers below are my examples. Remember to keep your part 1 answers short and simple. You don't need to show off in part 1.</p>
<p><em><strong>1. Tell me about the kind of accommodation you live in.</strong></em></p>
<p>I live in a house that has a living room, a kitchen, two bedrooms, a bathroom and a small garden. It's not a very big house, but it's just right for me.</p>
<p><em><strong>2. How long have you lived there?</strong></em></p>
<p>I've lived there for about five years. It's the first house that I've owned; before that I was renting an apartment.</p>
<p><em><strong>3. What do you like about living there?</strong></em></p>
<p>I like living there because I think the house reflects my personality: I decorated it myself, I chose all the furniture, and everything is where I want it to be.</p>
<p><em><strong>4. What sort of accommodation would you most like to live in?</strong></em></p>
<p>If I could, I'd buy a bigger house near a beach or in the mountains, preferably somewhere with a warm climate.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here are some useful phrases for describing causes and effects (for IELTS Writing Task 2 and maybe Speaking Part 3). I'll use the topic of 'global warming' to show how the phrases work.</p>
<p>1. Cause and Effect</p>
<p>Pollution <span style="text-decoration: underline;">causes</span> global warming.<br>Pollution <span style="text-decoration: underline;">leads to</span> global warming.<br>Pollution <span style="text-decoration: underline;">results in</span> global warming.<br>Pollution <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is the main cause of</span> global warming.<br>Factories pollute the atmosphere. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">As a result</span>, global warming is occurring.</p>
<p>2. Effect and Cause</p>
<p>Global warming <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is caused by</span> pollution.<br>Global warming <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is the result of</span> pollution.<br>Global warming <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is due to</span> pollution.<br>Global warming <span style="text-decoration: underline;">occurs as a result of</span> pollution.</p>
<p>Notice the different uses of 'result' (results in, is the result of, as a result). Students make a lot of mistakes with these phrases.</p>

				<p>One problem for students is that different teachers, books and websites teach different techniques. Students get confused.</p>
<p>My advice is to stop looking for the magic technique; it doesn't exist. There is no best book or website, and there are many different ways to write a good essay.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>You just need one way, one technique that you like. </strong></p>
<p>If you look at my lessons, you will see that I have "my technique" for each part of the exam (feel free to use my techniques if you like them). For example, I always write introductions in the same way, and I always start paragraphs with a topic sentence.</p>
<p>Because of the time limit in the exam, you NEED to know what you're going to do. You need to practise ONE way of working. Don't get confused by having too many options.</p>

<li>Facebook <span style="text-decoration: underline;">allows you to keep up to date</span> with what friends are doing.

				<p>Here are three quick tips for IELTS speaking part 2 (the short speech):</p>
<p><strong>1. Use the 1 minute preparation time well</strong><br>Think about how you would answer the question in your own language, then write down as many ideas as possible in English.</p>
<p><strong>2. Give real examples</strong><br>Say what you really think, talk about your real life, and give real examples. Examples are really important; whenever you don't know what to say, give an example from your own experience.</p>
<p><strong>3. Don't worry about grammar</strong><br>You haven't got time to think about passives or conditionals. Focus on answering the question - ideas and vocabulary.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here are some simple rules to help you with punctuation for IELTS writing:</p>
<p><strong>Full stops</strong><br>Full stops are very important. Put a clear full stop at the end of each sentence, and then begin the next sentence with a capital letter. If you don't do this, you will get a low score.</p>
<p><strong>Commas</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>When you start a sentence with these words, put a comma after them:<br>Nowadays, Recently, Firstly, Secondly, Finally, Furthermore, In addition, Also, However, By contrast, On the other hand, In my opinion,...</li>
<li>We use commas in lists:<br>e.g. This problem affects individuals, communities and society in general.</li>
<li>We don't usually put a comma after the word "that":<br>e.g. It is clear that the rate of immigration increased.</li>
<li>Don't worry about other uses of commas. The use of a comma is often optional in other situations.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Apostrophes</strong><br>Avoid contractions in IELTS writing. Use "do not" instead of "don't".<br>You may sometimes need to show possession e.g. the government's decision.</p>
<p><strong>Other punctuation</strong><br>You don't really need to use any other punctuation in IELTS writing.<br>My advice is to avoid trying to use colons and semicolons.</p>

	<p>
				<p>A lot of students write to me saying "I gave the IELTS test yesterday". Please note that "give an exam" is not correct.</p>
<p><strong>Don't say:</strong><br>- I gave an exam.<br>- I gave the IELTS test.</p>
<p><strong>Do say:</strong><br>- I took the IELTS exam/test.<br>- I passed the exam. (i.e. you were successful)</p>

	<p>
				<p>- Can you use the past tense when describing a person who is still alive?<br>- Which tense should you use when describing a person?</p>
<p>The answer to the first question is <em><strong>yes</strong></em>. You can say: "My father <span style="text-decoration: underline;">was</span> always a good role model for me when I was growing up." This doesn't mean that your father is no longer alive; it just means that you are no longer growing up!</p>
<p>The answer to the second question is <em><strong>it depends</strong></em>. As we saw above, you can use the past tense, but it would also be easy to add the present and/or future tense: "My father <span style="text-decoration: underline;">was</span> always kind to me when I was a child, and he still <span style="text-decoration: underline;">helps</span> me whenever I need something. I'm sure he <span style="text-decoration: underline;">will</span> always be there for me."</p>

	<p>
				<p>To improve your IELTS speaking score, use good examples to extend your answers. Real examples or stories about yourself are the best.</p>
<p>Use examples in part 2 when you need to make your presentation longer. Use them in part 3 to support your opinions.</p>
<p><strong>Here's an example that helps me to extend a part 2 presentation about my mobile phone:</strong></p>
<p>"For example, yesterday I used my phone to call some friends to arrange a get-together this weekend. Some of them didn't answer, so I either left a message in their voicemail or I sent them a text. I also replied to a few emails while I was waiting in a queue at the bank."</p>

	<p>
				<p>The first part of the IELTS Speaking Test lasts around 4 to 5 minutes. The examiner asks about 10 questions related to you, your daily life and your interests. Common topics are hobbies, family, friends, food, music etc.</p>
<p>Part 1 questions are supposed to be easy, and the examiner must get through all of the questions in 5 minutes or less. That's only about 30 seconds per question. If you try to give long answers, the examiner will interrupt you. My advice is to keep Part 1 answers very simple:</p>
<p><strong>Do you prefer home-cooked food or food from restaurants?</strong></p>
<p><strong>I prefer home-cooked food because I think it's healthier and you know exactly what you're eating. I also enjoy cooking for family and friends.</strong></p>
<p>You don't need to say any more than this. Just answer the question with a full sentence, give a reason, and maybe add one extra piece of information. Then stop speaking. <em>Stop with confidence and look at the examiner, ready for the next question.</em></p>

	<p>
				<p>Students often ask whether it's necessary to speak for the full 2 minutes in part 2 of the speaking test. The instruction is: <strong><em>speak for between 1 and 2 minutes</em></strong>, so it's not strictly necessary to speak for the full 2 minutes. However, my advice is that you should <em><strong>try</strong></em> to keep speaking until the examiner stops you.</p>
<p>Here are some tips to help you keep talking:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go through the bullet points on the task card in order.</li>
<li>Try to develop each point, even easy ones. For example, if the first bullet point for the topic "describe a person" is "who is it?", don't just say "I'm going to describe my father". Add more information, such as your father's name, age, what he looks like, where he is now, how often you speak to him...</li>
<li>Give examples and tell stories (<a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2012/02/ielts-speaking-advice-tell-stories.html" target="_self">click here</a> for more advice about this).</li>

<ol>
<li>You could describe a photo of your family on a special occasion (e.g. a birthday party). This would allow you to talk about the members of your family and tell the story of what happened at the party when the photo was taken. Alternatively, you could describe a holiday photo of a place you visited. Then you can talk about the place and what you did there.</li>
<li>If you have a job, you could describe the letter you received telling you that you got the job. You could talk about the job interview, how you felt when you received the letter, and what you now do in your job.

	<p>
				<p><em><strong>At work or in your studies, do you often write things?</strong></em></p>
<p>Yes, I write a lot of emails as part of my job. I work for a company that has offices in several countries, so we use email to communicate.</p>

<p><em><strong>Do you prefer to write by hand or on a computer?</strong></em></p>
<p>It depends what I’m doing. I prefer the computer for most things because it’s faster and you can save or copy things, but I still like making notes or writing ideas down by hand.</p>
<p><em><strong>Do you think computers might one day replace handwriting?</strong></em></p>
<p>No, I think we will always write by hand as well. I think it’s an important skill, and schools will continue to teach children to write by hand before they learn to type.</p>

	<p>
				<p><em><strong>1. What do you think are the functions of rivers nowadays?</strong></em></p>
<p>Rivers have various functions. In the UK, they were probably more  important in the past because they were used for the transportation of  goods, but I suppose this is still the case in many parts of the world.  Rivers can be used as a source of renewable energy in the production of  hydro-electric power, and they are also a source of fresh water for  drinking and irrigation. Leisure activities are another function:  fishing, canoeing, swimming, bathing... I'm sure there are many other things I  haven't thought of.</p>
<p><em><strong>2. What do you think of boats and ships as forms of transportation?</strong></em></p>
<p>I'm not really a fan of boats and ships. If I'm going abroad, I like  to get to my destination quickly, so I prefer travelling by plane. Of  course, ships are vital for the transportation of oil and other heavy  cargo.</p>
<p><em><strong>3. Why do some people like to live near rivers, lakes or the sea?</strong></em></p>
<p>Well, the view is probably a major factor; most people like to look out to sea, or across a river or lake. I'd much prefer to look out of my window onto a natural landscape than an apartment building in a city. Then there's the lifestyle: if you live by the sea, for example, you can lie on the beach, go for a swim, or do water sports like surfing or waterskiing. I definitely wouldn't mind living near a beach at some point in my life!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Note:</strong></span><br>These answers are less formal than the essays I write for the writing test, and I say things like "probably" or "I suppose" when I'm not sure about the facts.</p>

				<p>A few people have asked me about using capital letters in different parts of the IELTS test. Here's my advice:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the reading and listening tests, they don't care about capital letters. So you can write everything in lowercase or in capitals, and it won't affect your score.</li>
<li>In the writing test, try to follow the normal rules for capital letters. Grammar books and websites explain these rules in detail. <a href="https://www.englishclub.com/writing/caps0.htm" target="_self">Click here</a> to see a website that summarises the rules quite well.</li>

	<p>
				<p>Yesterday I made the point that 'real content' (topic-specific words and phrases) is much more important than linking phrases. To see a good example of real content, look back to Wednesday's lesson about main body paragraphs.</p>
<p>Here's some of the band 7-9 vocabulary that I used:</p>
<ul>
<li>a defined career path</li>
<li>a great sense of satisfaction</li>
<li>work towards (and gradually achieve) goals</li>
<li>realise an ambition</li>
<li>gain the relevant qualifications</li>
<li>undertake years of training</li>
<li>find their work rewarding</li>
<li>invest time and effort</li>
</ul>
<p>The above phrases came from just one paragraph! To be honest, the paragraphs I wrote on Wednesday are beyond (better than) what an examiner would ever expect to read. So don't worry if you can't write paragraphs like that; just try to learn something from them.</p>

				<p>A student asked me a really useful (and common) question the other day.</p>
<p><em><strong>Student's question:</strong></em></p>
<p>I've gone through your speaking answers, and I rarely found linking phrases like <em>"I suppose I should begin by highlighting the fact that..."</em> or <em>"the point I'd like to begin with is that..."</em>. Don't you think such phrases are the sign of a high score?</p>
<p><em><strong>Here's my answer:</strong></em></p>
<p>Good question. No, I don't use those phrases because examiners are not impressed by them. Even a beginner can learn linking phrases, and if it were that easy, everyone would get band 9. The sign of a high score is 'real content' (<a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2011/12/ielts-vocabulary-topic-specific-vocabulary.html" target="_self">topic-specific vocabulary</a>), not memorised phrases.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Last week I described a famous garden. Martin, an IELTS teacher who often contributes to the comments on this site, sent me a description of his own garden. You might find it more useful than my famous garden description!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Martin's description:</span></p>
<p>Today I'd like to describe my home garden, which I think is a beautiful one and which I like very much. The garden is part of my home's backyard, and my house is located in the suburbs, about a 1-hour drive from the city of San Francisco. There is a big tree right in the middle of my garden, which is surrounded by a hot tub, a small water fountain, several bushes, a section for vegetables, and different kinds of flowers.</p>
<p>This garden was actually one of the reasons why my wife and I chose to buy our house because it had been beautifully maintained by the previous owner’s gardener and landscaper. It’s been only 1 year since we bought the house and now we are taking care of the garden ourselves. Even though we are not experts in gardening, we still try our best to plant things that we like, such as roses and tulips, and we even grow our own tomatoes.</p>
<p>Whenever family and friends come to visit us, we invite them to have a relaxing time in our hot tub, and enjoy the view. So in other words, our garden has also become a kind of resort! It definitely requires lots of hard work to properly maintain the garden, but it gives us a great sense of accomplishment to “decorate” it the way we like.</p>
<p>All in all, the garden is one of the best features of my home and it is a place where I can relax after a long day of work or during the weekends.</p>

It's in a place called Giverny, which is in northern France, about an hour away from Paris in the province of Normandy.</li>
<li>There are actually two gardens at the Monet house in Giverny: a flower garden, and a Japanese inspired water garden. Apparently, Monet designed the gardens himself; he even had the pond and the famous Japanese bridge made. After creating the gardens, Monet painted some of the most well-known paintings in the world, such as those of the waterlilies below the bridge on his pond.</li>
<li>Thousands of people visit the gardens at Giverny to see the magnificent scenes that inspired Monet's paintings. Visitors can walk around the gardens and take pictures, which is what I did when I went there.</li>
<li>I like Monet's gardens because they are such beautiful creations, and it's amazing to see the 'real thing' having seen the famous paintings so many times.</li>

				<p>Yesterday I said that linking words don't help your vocabulary score, and that you need to use 'topic specific' vocabulary if you want a high score.</p>
<p>But what is 'topic specific' vocabulary?</p>
<p>The answer is: vocabulary that you would probably only use for one particular essay question. For example, I used this vocabulary in a lesson last week:</p>
<p>- impoverished or disadvantaged<br>- prioritise local charity<br>- those who live beyond our national borders<br>- curable diseases<br>- paying for vaccines that already exist</p>
<p>You might be able to adapt these phrases to a different topic, but it wouldn't be easy; they are quite specific to the particular question in <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2011/12/ielts-writing-task-2-help-essay.html" target="_self">this lesson</a>.

	<p>
				<p>The following questions come from Cambridge IELTS 7. I've underlined some of the good words and phrases in my answers.</p>
<p><em><strong>1. Why do you think some school teachers use competitions as class activities?</strong></em></p>
<p>I think teachers use competitions to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">motivate</span> the children in their classes. I'm sure that teachers try all kinds of activities to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">engage</span> their pupils, and competitions might be one of the best ways to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">keep children interested</span> or <span style="text-decoration: underline;">get them excited</span>. Children love winning things.</p>
<p><em><strong>2. Is it a good thing to give prizes to children who do well at school? Why?</strong></em></p>
<p>It might be a good idea to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">encourage</span> children to do well in games or sports, but I don't think we should give children prizes for their <span style="text-decoration: underline;">academic work</span>. Children need to learn that the reason for studying is to learn useful things that will help them in their lives. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I don't like the idea of</span> children thinking that they will only work hard if there is a prize.</p>
<p><em><strong>3. Would you say that schools for young children have become more or less competitive since you were that age? Why?</strong></em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I'd say that</span> they have become more competitive since I was young. Children now have to take exams from a much younger age, so I think there is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">more of a focus on</span> doing well in tests. Parents also seem to be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">getting more competitive</span>; I think that many <span style="text-decoration: underline;">parents push their children</span> to do extra homework <span style="text-decoration: underline;">rather than letting</span> them play with friends.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Somebody asked me about the difference between these 4 words (for IELTS writing task 1). I'll try to explain some basic ways to use them.</p>
<p><strong>number</strong><br>- Use "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">the number of</span> + plural noun" e.g. the number of visitors.<br>- Don't use it to describe percentages or uncountable nouns e.g. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">money</span>.</p>
<p><strong>amount</strong><br>- Use "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">the amount of</span> + uncountable noun" e.g. the amount of money.<br>- Don't use it with countable nouns e.g. the amount of <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">person</span>/<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">people</span>.</p>
<p><strong>proportion</strong><br>- Only use this to describe percentages (not numbers).<br>- Use "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">the proportion of</span> + plural noun" e.g. the proportion of people.</p>
<p><strong>figure</strong><br>- Use "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">the figure for</span> + plural noun" e.g. the figure for visitors to the UK.<br>- Use it with uncountable nouns e.g. the figure for unemployment.<br>- Use it with countries e.g. the figure for Canada.<br>- Use it with percentages e.g. the figure (for...) rose to 10%.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em><br>If you've read any of my task 1 essays, you'll see that I like "the figure for" because it can be used in almost any situation.</p>

	<p>
				<p>In part 2 of the IELTS Speaking test, you might have to describe your favourite film ('movie' is American English). My advice is to look for your film on amazon.com. You will find reviews of almost any film, from <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Godfather-Trilogy-Remastered-Collection-DVD/dp/B0014E917Y/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=dvd&amp;qid=1275672537&amp;sr=1-1">The Godfather</a> to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Titanic-DVD-Leonardo-DiCaprio/dp/B00004CZDS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=dvd&amp;qid=1275673214&amp;sr=1-1">Titanic</a>.</p>
<p>The only problem is that the reviews are often quite difficult or too detailed. I recommend stealing a few ideas or a few bits of good vocabulary.</p>
<p>For example, here is some good vocabulary from a review of <em>The Godfather</em>:</p>
<p>- one of the greatest films ever made<br>- a masterpiece<br>- a brilliant story<br>- the actors' performances are outstanding<br>- it's compelling to watch</p>
<p>Make sure you can summarise the film's plot (the story). Try to remember where and when you first saw the film. Explain how it made you feel and why you like it.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Some students (both in my classes and online) find it hard to believe that all of my essays are band 9. They are under the impression that you need to use "difficult" language to get a high score. This is how I respond:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is "difficult" language? Language is not mathematics; anyone can learn and understand a word or phrase.</li>
<li>The most difficult thing is using words together correctly and naturally. Small words like articles and prepositions cause the most problems.</li>
<li>If an essay has no grammar mistakes and a mix of long and short sentences, it's almost certain that it will get band 9 for grammar.</li>
<li>If ideas are explained and developed in a clear, logical way, you will get a high score for coherence and cohesion.</li>
<li>If you try to make your writing over-complicated, it will seem forced and unnatural.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember: if an essay is difficult to read, it's probably badly written. Good writing is surprisingly easy to read, and the arguments are easy to follow.</p>

<p><em><strong>Do you think it’s good to show your emotions when you’re angry?</strong></em></p>
<p>I think it depends on the situation and how you show your emotions. I find that if I’m angry with a friend or someone in my family, it’s best to tell them what the problem is and try to express how I feel. However, I don’t think it helps to argue with people when you’re angry; it’s better to control the anger and explain what’s wrong.</p>
<p><em><strong>In your opinion, do women show their emotions more than men?</strong></em></p>
<p>The stereotypical view is that women are more emotional, and in my experience there is some truth in this; my mother, for example, tends to show her feelings much more readily than my father. However, I’m sure that there are exceptions to the stereotype.</p>
<p><em><strong>Why do you think men tend to show their emotions less than women?</strong></em></p>
<p>Maybe it’s because of the way we are brought up. I think that boys are often taught from an early age not to cry. Also, boys are aware that their friends might see it as a sign of weakness if they show their feelings. Perhaps girls are brought up to be more sensitive to their friends' feelings.</p>

				<p>Students often don't notice when a teacher corrects their mistakes.</p>
<p>Look at this example of a conversation between a teacher and a student:</p>
<p>Teacher: <em>How long have you been living in Manchester?</em><br>Student: <em>I came here before one month?</em><br>Teacher: <em>One month ago?</em><br>Student: <em>Yes, before one month.</em></p>
<p>The student doesn't notice that the teacher is correcting a mistake. In English we don't say "before one month", we say "one month ago".</p>
<p>When a teacher repeats something that you said in a different way, you probably made a mistake. Listen carefully, and try to notice mistakes and corrections.</p>

<p><em><strong>Do you think people had easier lives 50 years ago?</strong></em><br>Yes, maybe life <span style="text-decoration: underline;">was</span> simpler and less stressful 50 years ago. The mobile phone <span style="text-decoration: underline;">didn’t</span> exist, so I suppose it <span style="text-decoration: underline;">was</span> easier to forget about work at the end of the day because people <span style="text-decoration: underline;">couldn't</span> contact you so easily.</p>
<p><em><strong>Do you think life will be more stressful in the future?</strong></em><br>Yes, it probably <span style="text-decoration: underline;">will</span> be more stressful. As the world gets smaller, employees <span style="text-decoration: underline;">will</span> probably have to travel to different countries more often and stay in touch with colleagues and clients all over the world. There <span style="text-decoration: underline;">will</span> also be more competition for jobs and the cost of living <span style="text-decoration: underline;">will</span> keep going up.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here are some questions that a student sent me, with example answers below.</p>
<p><em><strong>1. What is the relationship between leisure and the economy?</strong></em></p>
<p>Well, people spend a lot of money on all sorts of leisure activities nowadays, so I think leisure is a very important part of the economy of most countries. Leisure could be anything that people do in their free time, such as eating out, going to the cinema, watching a football match, or staying in a hotel. Millions of people are employed in these areas.</p>
<p><em><strong>2. How does the economy benefit from people's leisure activities?</strong></em></p>
<p>The leisure industry makes a huge contribution to the economy. As I said before, it keeps millions of people in employment, and all of these employees pay their taxes and have money to spend on other goods and services. At the same time, most people spend some of their earnings on leisure activities, and this money therefore goes back into the economy.</p>
<p><em><strong>3. Do men and women enjoy the same type of leisure activities?</strong></em></p>
<p>Yes and no. I think both men and women enjoy things like eating in restaurants or going to the cinema, but I'm sure there are other activities that are more popular with one gender. For example, I think more men than women go to football matches.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here are some mistakes that can really affect your IELTS score:</p>
<ol>
<li>Writing less than 150 or 250 words. My advice: count how many words you write, on average, per line. If you write about 10 words per line, make sure that you write more than 25 lines for writing task 2.</li>
<li>Not separating paragraphs. Your score will immediately drop if you don't separate paragraphs clearly. My advice: leave a full line between paragraphs.</li>
<li>Not answering the question (writing and speaking). My advice: in the writing exam, keep checking the question to make sure you are answering it fully. In the speaking exam, answer the question directly, then explain your answer.</li>
<li>Not finishing the reading test. My advice: you must get to the end of the test paper. If you get stuck on a difficult question, miss it out and return to it later.</li>
<li>Making spelling mistakes in the listening test. My advice: if you have a spelling problem, you must keep a list of your mistakes and learn the correct spellings by heart. Test yourself every day.</li>

	<p>
				<p><em><strong>Describe a situation that made you angry. You should say</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>- when it happened</strong></em><br><em><strong>- what happened</strong></em><br><em><strong>- how you felt</strong></em></p>
<p>Here are some ideas. Notice that I answer by telling a story, and that my ideas are not 'academic' or 'formal' because it isn't an academic topic. Study my answer carefully - it's full of good words and phrases.</p>
<p><em><strong>Band 9 answer:</strong></em></p>
<p>A recent situation that made me angry was getting stuck in a traffic jam on the way to meet some friends. It was last Sunday lunchtime, and I didn’t expect there to be much traffic; people don’t work on Sundays, so the roads aren’t usually very busy.</p>
<p>Everything was going well until suddenly I saw a queue of cars on the road in front of me. I had no choice but to join the queue and wait to get past whatever was causing the delay. It turned out that it was caused by some roadworks, and it took me an extra 30 minutes to get past them.</p>
<p>Getting stuck in traffic congestion doesn’t usually make me angry, but this time it did, mainly because I wasn’t expecting it and I knew that my friends were waiting to meet me for lunch. I felt frustrated and powerless because there was nothing I could do to change the situation, and I had no idea how long I would be sitting there waiting. When I finally saw the reason for the congestion, I was relieved that I was close to getting past the roadworks, but I still felt a bit stressed knowing that I was half an hour late.</p>

	<p>
				<p>The following questions are taken from Cambridge IELTS 7, page 55. The aim in part 1 is to give <em>short, simple </em>answers. Don't worry about using 'difficult' grammar.</p>
<p><em><strong>1. What kinds of thing make you laugh?</strong></em></p>
<p>I laugh most when I'm with friends talking about funny things that have happened to us. I also like watching comedians and comedy films.</p>
<p><em><strong>2. Do you like making other people laugh?</strong></em></p>
<p>Yes, it's a nice feeling when you can make someone laugh because you can see that you've made them happy. It's great to share a funny moment with someone.</p>
<p><em><strong>3. Do you think it's important for people to laugh?</strong></em></p>
<p>Yes, of course. It's important to see the funny side of things; humour helps us not to take life too seriously. I think that laughter is good for our health.</p>
<p><em><strong>4. Is laughing the same as feeling happy?</strong></em></p>
<p>It's not exactly the same because you can be happy without laughing, and sometimes we laugh when something bad has happened; a sense of humour can help us to cope with difficult situations.</p>

	<p>
				<p>In part 2 of the speaking test you might be asked to <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2011/01/ielts-speaking.html" target="_self">describe a party</a>. Here are some part 3 questions that could follow that topic:</p>
<p><em><strong>1. What types of party do people have, and why are parties important?</strong></em></p>
<p>People have parties to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">celebrate special occasions</span> like birthdays, weddings, or the beginning of a new year. I think it's important to celebrate these things because they are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">landmarks in our lives</span>. Parties are a good way to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">bring people together</span>, and they're an opportunity to <a href="https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/let+off+steam" target="_self">let off some steam</a>.</p>
<p><em><strong>2. Why do you think some people like parties but others hate them?</strong></em></p>
<p>Most people like parties because they <span style="text-decoration: underline;">have a good time at them</span> - eating a nice meal, chatting to friends, or having a dance. People who don't like them might <span style="text-decoration: underline;">find social situations difficult</span> because they are shy, or maybe they don't enjoy having to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">make small talk</span> with people they don't know.</p>
<p><em><strong>3. Do you think parties will become more popular in the future?</strong></em></p>
<p>No, I don't think anything will change. People <span style="text-decoration: underline;">have always had</span> parties, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I'm sure they always will</span> in the future. Humans need to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">socialise and enjoy themselves</span>, and parties are one of the best ways to do that.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Students often don't notice when a teacher corrects their mistakes.</p>
<p>Look at this example of a conversation between a student and a teacher:</p>
<p><strong>Student:</strong> <em>I gave the IELTS exam last week.</em><br><strong>Teacher:</strong> <em>Oh, you mean you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">took</span> the exam last week?</em><br><strong>Student:</strong> <em>Yes, I have given the exam twice.</em> (should be 'taken')</p>

<p>When a teacher repeats something that you said in a different way, you probably made a mistake. Listen carefully, and try to correct yourself.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here are some Part 3 questions and band 9 answers for this topic. I've underlined the 'band 7-9' vocabulary.</p>
<p><em><strong>What effects do you think humans have on wild animals?</strong></em></p>
<p>Humans <span style="text-decoration: underline;">have a huge impact on</span> wild animals. We have <span style="text-decoration: underline;">destroyed a lot of natural habitats</span>, and many animals are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in danger of extinction</span>. Tigers and rhinos, for example, are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">endangered species</span> because of humans. The pollution and waste that we produce also have an effect on animals. In some places there are no fish in the rivers.</p>
<p><em><strong>What measures could we take to protect wildlife?</strong></em></p>
<p>I think we need <span style="text-decoration: underline;">stricter rules to protect natural areas</span> and the wild animals that live there. For example, we should stop cutting down trees in the rain forest. National parks are a good idea because they <span style="text-decoration: underline;">attract tourists while protecting wildlife</span>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Is it the responsibility of schools to teach children about protecting wildlife?</strong></em></p>
<p>Yes, schools can <span style="text-decoration: underline;">play a big part in educating children about this issue</span>. Children should learn how to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">look after the natural environment</span>. I think schools already teach children about <span style="text-decoration: underline;">endangered species</span> and the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">destruction of rain forests</span>, so hopefully <span style="text-decoration: underline;">future generations will do a better job of protecting wildlife</span>.</p>

				<p>In the example answers below, I've underlined some of the phrases that examiners would like. They might seem easy to understand, but they are the kind of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">natural phrases</span> that native speakers use. My answers are at band 9 level.</p>
<p><em><strong>1. Why do you think sport is important?</strong></em></p>
<p>I think sport is important for different reasons. For me, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">doing a sport is about having fun</span>. When I play football, for example, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I forget about everything else and just</span> enjoy myself. Also, doing a sport helps you to keep fit and healthy, and it's <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a good way to socialise</span> and make friends.</p>
<p><em><strong>2. Do you think famous sportspeople are good role models for children?</strong></em></p>
<p>I think that sportspeople should be good role models. Children <span style="text-decoration: underline;">look up to</span> their favourite football players, like David Beckham for example, so I think that these people <span style="text-decoration: underline;">have an enormous responsibility</span>. They should try to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">be a good influence</span>, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">behave in the right way</span>.</p>
<p><em><strong>3. Do you agree that sports stars earn too much money?</strong></em></p>
<p>In my opinion, it's fair that the best sportspeople earn a lot of money. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Being a top sportsperson requires hours of practice</span>, and there are millions of sports fans <span style="text-decoration: underline;">who are willing to pay</span> to see them play. If we don't want sportspeople to earn so much money, we shouldn't go to watch them.</p>

<li><em><strong> how they became successful</strong></em></li>
<li><em><strong> how you found out about them</strong></em></li>
<li><em><strong> and why you admire them</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p>I've tried to write a general example description that might help you with some ideas. In your description you <em><strong>must</strong></em> give the name of the person.</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m going to talk about a musician that I admire, called... He’s a singer who also plays the guitar and writes his own songs. I think he recorded his first album about 10 years ago, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">he’s released several other CDs since then</span>.</li>
<li>He became successful after many years of writing songs and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">performing live in small venues</span> all over the country. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Gradually he built a following</span> of people who liked his music. I think <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the key to his success</span> was one of his songs that was used on a TV advertisement. This meant that more <span style="text-decoration: underline;">people became aware of</span> his music.</li>
<li>I found out about... because one of my friends got tickets to see him in concert. I hadn’t heard any of his music before, but <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I went along to the gig</span> and really enjoyed it. After that I bought the first CD, and now I’ve got all of them.</li>
<li>The reason I admire... is that he has worked hard for his success: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">it takes years of practice</span> to become a good singer and guitarist, and he spent several years <span style="text-decoration: underline;">playing to very small audiences</span> before he became successful. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I also like the fact that he writes his own music</span>. I admire <span style="text-decoration: underline;">people who have worked hard to get where they are</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> I've underlined the best vocabulary. 'Gig' is an informal word for concert or performance, but it's fine to use it in this context.</p>

<p>"Professors and PhDs were slower than undergraduates to begin to solve the problems. The experts paused before they put pencil to paper. They spent a few minutes assessing the structure of the problem and figuring out the best physics principle to use. The undergraduates, on the other hand, jumped right into problem solving, which often got them in trouble."<span style="font-size: 8pt;"><br>(<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Choke-Secrets-Reveal-Success-Failure/dp/1849016453/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1311334467&amp;sr=1-1" target="_self">Click here</a> to see the book this comes from)</span></p>

	<p>
				<p>More advice about describing your favourite book, film or piece of music:</p>
<ol>
<li>You can talk about any type of book (textbook, biography etc.). You only need to describe a story if the question asks you to describe a 'novel'. </li>
<li>Many books are also films. It would be a good idea to prepare one description that you can use for both. </li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon.com</a> is great for reviews of books, films and music. Just search for a title, then go down the page to find the reviews. </li>
<li>"Steal" the best vocabulary from the reviews that you find. </li>
<li>Use Google. I searched for "my favourite film is" on Google and found this <a href="http://www.gumbopages.com/chuck/films.html">'My Favourite Films' website</a>. It's full of good ideas. </li>
<li>Try this Google search: "my favourite piece of music is" </li>
<li>You can describe a book, film or piece of music from your country. </li>
<li>You can invent a story if necessary, but it's easier to tell the truth. </li>
<li>If you don't like books, pretend that your favourite film is a book (and vice versa). </li>
<li>Remember to include adjectives to describe your feelings/opinions. Tell the story of when you first read the book, saw the film or listened to the song, who recommended it, why you like it etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>NB. 'Piece of music' just means a song.</p>

	<p>
				<p><strong>A student asked me this question:</strong></p>
<p>"If the question asks me to describe a film, can I ask for a different question because I don't like films and I never watch them?"</p>
<p><strong>Here's my answer:</strong></p>
<p>If the part 2 question is about something you don't like, you should try your best. The examiner is not allowed to change the task card.</p>
<p>You probably have family, children or friends who watch films. You could say: "I don't really like watching films, but my children love watching ....." Then describe the film that your children like, say why they like it, and explain why you think it's a nice film for children.</p>
<p>Choose a film now so that you are ready for this question. Search for a review of the film on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dmovies-tv&amp;field-keywords=&amp;x=10&amp;y=19" target="_self">Amazon</a>.

<p><em><strong>Answer:</strong></em><br>I think friendship is important for all sorts of reasons. <strong>(why?)</strong> We need friends to share experiences with, to talk to, and for support. <strong>(example?)</strong> In my case, I like to meet up with friends at the weekend to do something enjoyable, like see a film or go out for dinner. I like chatting with my friends about what we've been doing during the week, or about what's happening in the world. <strong>(alternatives?)</strong> Without friends to talk to, life would be dull and boring; we would only have our families to talk to.</p>

<li>I'm going to talk about an interesting science lesson that I attended at secondary school when I was 14 or 15 years old.</li>
<li>It was quite a long time ago, so I can't remember every detail, but the lesson was about respiration. We learnt about how the lungs work, how we breathe, and how oxygen passes into the blood. The science teacher also talked to us about the effects of smoking on the lungs.</li>
<li>I found this lesson interesting because my science teacher, Dr. Smith, always introduced new topics by showing us a video. We watched a short film about how respiration works, and I found this much easier to understand than a science textbook. The film showed diagrams of the lungs to explain the breathing process. Later in the lesson we saw real photos of healthy lungs and lungs that had been damaged as a result of smoking; they had turned black. I think the image of a smoker's lungs is the reason why I remember this lesson.</li>
</ol>
<p>I could also give more information about the teacher, his personality and why I liked him. The key is to <em><strong>tell a story</strong></em> and add details until the time runs out.</p>

	<p>
				<p>When deciding whether to give a band 7 in IELTS speaking or writing, one of the things that examiners look at is your use of collocations.</p>
<p>'Collocation' basically means using the right words together. Many students know a lot of nouns, but they don't always know the right verbs to use with those nouns.</p>
<p>Here are some useful 'verb + noun' collocations:</p>
<ul>
<li>to make a mistake (not 'do' a mistake)</li>
<li>to do/carry out/conduct research (not 'make' research, not 'a' research)</li>
<li>to make/take/reach a decision</li>
<li>to have/gain/lack experience</li>
<li>to have/face/experience difficulties</li>
</ul>
<p>Think about this, especially when you are writing essays. Check in a dictionary to make sure you have used the right verb with the right noun.</p>

<li>If you like football, you could talk about the news that Barcelona won the Champions League.</li>
<li>If you have studied the "health" topic for IELTS writing, you could talk about schools banning junk food.

<li><strong><em>what it is used for</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>and why you like/dislike it.</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Here's my example description of a building in Manchester:</p>
<ol>
<li>I'm going to describe a modern building in Manchester. It's called the Beetham Tower, and it's the tallest building in the city, with about 50 floors.</li>
<li>Although it's called the Beetham Tower, most people know this building as the Hilton Hotel. In fact, the bottom half of the tower is the hotel and the top half is apartments. The apartments are expensive because the location and views make them very desirable.<a href="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c0120a8d7ae98970b-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Beetham" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c0120a8d7ae98970b " src="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c0120a8d7ae98970b-120wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;"></a> </li>
<li>I'm not sure if I like the design of the building, it's just a huge glass tower, but it definitely stands out. It has become a famous landmark in the city. You can see it as you approach Manchester, and it's an easy place to meet people because it's so distinctive and easy to find. The most interesting thing about the Beetham Tower is that there is a bar/restaurant on the 23rd floor which has spectacular views of the city; it's definitely the best vantage point in Manchester because there are no walls, only huge windows, so you can look out over the city in any direction. I'd recommend anyone who visits Manchester to go there and experience the view.</li>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">IELTS speaking part 3:</span></p>
<p><em><strong>What kinds of organisation regularly conduct questionnaires?</strong></em></p>
<p>All kinds of organisations and companies use questionnaires to find out what people think about them. For example, university lecturers often ask their students to answer questions about their courses. Someone from a Starbucks cafe stopped me in the street yesterday to ask me about my coffee drinking habits.</p>
<p><em><strong>Do you think schools should ask children for their opinions about lessons?</strong></em></p>
<p>On the one hand, it might be useful for teachers to get feedback from children about how much they learnt and how enjoyable they found the lessons. However, children don't necessarily know what's best for them, and it might do more harm than good to allow them to give opinions about their teachers.</p>

	<p>
				<p><strong>IELTS Speaking Part 2:</strong><br>Describe an important conversation you had.</p>
<p><strong>IELTS Speaking Part 3:</strong><br>What are the differences between men's and women's conversations?<br>What do you think are the characteristics of a good speaker?</p>
<p><strong>For the part 2 question:</strong></p>
<p>My advice is to speak about a conversation you had with your father or mother about your education or career. If you are studying in a different country, describe a conversation about the decision to study abroad. Then you can use ideas from the 'study abroad' topic and the 'higher education' topic (you can find these topics in my Writing Task 2 lessons).</p>
<p><strong>For the first question in part 3, my advice is to use 'stereotypes':</strong></p>
<p>"I think it depends on the people who are having the conversation, and it depends on the situation, but most people would say that men talk more about sport or cars, whereas women talk about their friends, family and relationships. Women are supposed to be better at expressing their feelings, while men prefer not to talk about themselves."</p>
<p><strong>For the second question in part 3, use adjectives and examples:</strong></p>
<p>"I think good speakers are confident and passionate about the subject of their speech. They need to be interesting and engaging. I think a speaker's body language is also really important. A famous example of a great speaker is Barack Obama; he seems to be a naturally inspiring speaker, but I'm sure that practice and preparation are more important than natural talent."</p>

<ol>
<li>I'm going to talk about driving, which is a practical skill that I use almost every day.</li>
<li>I learnt to drive a car by taking lessons when I was 17. My parents paid for me to have lessons with a professional driving instructor. I learnt by practising: first I had to get used to steering, changing gears and using the mirrors, then we practised things like reversing and parking. I also had to learn the highway code.</li>
<li>As a 17-year-old, I wanted to have the experience of driving a car, and I was fed up with having to walk or take the bus or train whenever I wanted to go somewhere. I also knew that driving would be an extremely useful skill.</li>
<li>Being able to drive has helped me in so many ways. The public transport where I live isn't very good, so I travel to work by car most days. Having a car makes my life much easier when it comes to things like shopping or visiting family and friends. (Last week, for example,...)</li>

	<p>
				<p>This week I've been thinking about different ways to use the 1-minute preparation time. Here's what I've learnt:</p>
<ol>
<li>One minute is a very short amount of time! I found it just as difficult as my students did.</li>
<li>A simple list is probably faster and easier than a diagram or mind map.</li>
<li>You need to decide on your topic as quickly as possible. Then spend most of your time making notes.</li>
<li>Try to write at least one key idea for each part of the question.</li>
<li>Don't write sentences, and don't waste time erasing "mistakes".</li>
<li>Try to use a topic you have already prepared.</li>
<li>Forget about grammar. Focus on answering the question.</li>
<li>Finally, fast preparation is a skill that you can practise. Why not train yourself by making notes for a few different questions every day?</li>
</ol>
<p>The following photo shows a part 2 question with my notes below. As you can see, I couldn't write much in 1 minute, but I followed the advice above.</p>

				<p>On Wednesday I wrote a lesson about introductions for IELTS writing task 2. Since then, several students have asked me this question:</p>
<p><em><strong>"Will my introduction get a good score?"</strong></em></p>
<p>Answer: your introduction <em>alone</em> will not get you a high score, even if it is perfect. The introduction is necessary, but the main body paragraphs decide your score.</p>
<p>Write a short, clear introduction. Then spend most of your time on the main body of the essay.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Jay sent me this interesting IELTS question:</p>
<p><em><strong>Describe a foreign person that you like. You should say:</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>- where you met him/her</strong></em><br><em><strong>- why you like him/her</strong></em><br><em><strong> - and explain what you learnt from him/her</strong></em></p>
<p>Some advice:</p>
<ol>
<li>The easy choice would be to describe an English teacher. You could then talk about your lessons and easily explain what you learnt.</li>
<li>I think it would be acceptable to describe someone you have never met. Just say "I've never met the person I'm going to describe, but I hope to meet him/her one day".</li>
<li>If you do number 2 above, choose your hero. It's best to choose someone you know a lot about. Give as much real information as possible. Do some Google research to get ideas.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, remember that this is a "describe a person" question. Hopefully you can use some of the ideas from <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2010/11/ielts-speaking-part-2-describe-a-person.html" target="_self">this lesson</a>.</p>

<li><strong><em>While</em></strong> and <strong><em>whilst</em></strong> are the same, but <strong><em>whilst</em></strong> is a bit more formal (according to one famous grammar book).</li>
<li><strong><em>Whereas</em></strong> is always used for contrast. <strong><em>While/whilst</em></strong> can be used for contrast, OR to mean "at the same time".</li>
<li><strong><em>As</em></strong> can mean "because" or "exactly at the moment when".</li>

				<p>You can't use 'however' and 'whereas' in the same way. Follow these general rules in order to avoid grammar mistakes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Some people believe that schools are responsible for the behaviour of their students, whereas others argue that discipline is the responsibility of parents.</li>

				<p>When I was working as an examiner, I noticed that many students <em><strong>overuse</strong></em> 'moreover', 'furthermore' and 'in addition'. Some students seem to think that using these linking words will help them to get a 7. This is wrong.</p>
<p>Don't overuse these words. Although they can be useful, you should not begin every sentence with one of them. Use them occasionally.</p>
<p>Remember, all IELTS students learn linking words like 'moreover', so examiners are not impressed by them. If you want to impress the examiner, you need to use good vocabulary related to the question topic.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em><br>Don't forget to use the word 'and'. As a native speaker, I probably use 'and' much more than any other linking word.</p>

<li>She treat everyone equally. (should be 'treat<span style="text-decoration: underline;">s</span>')</li>
<li>I was really shy when I was young and I rarely talked to strangers, so she gave me this advice to teach me how to deal with people.</li>

	<p>
				<p>Last week I looked at how to use the word 'because'. One of my students then asked me to explain the difference between 'because' and 'because of'.</p>
<p>Compare these two sentences:</p>

<p>The important difference is the use of the word 'was' in the first sentence. After 'because', you need a subject and a verb (e.g. the weather was). After 'because of', we don't use a verb, only a noun, nouns or noun phrase.</p>

<p><strong>Personal perspective:</strong><br>I think the Internet will have a huge impact on our lives. More and more people are using social websites to keep in touch with friends. I think the Internet will probably replace TV because most channels are already available online.</p>
<p><strong>Economic perspective:</strong><br>Also, I think we'll do more online shopping. Web-based companies like Amazon are already really successful.

<li>The advert shows a picture of Santa Claus smiling and holding a bottle of Coke. I think <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the aim is to target children</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">associate (link/connect) the brand with</span> Christmas time.</li>
<li>The advert is interesting because the company is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">deliberately trying to influence and attract</span> children. The marketers are trying to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">capture young customers</span>. They are presenting the drink as something special, a gift for Christmas. However, Coca-Cola is not necessarily a healthy drink for children; it contains a lot of sugar. Maybe this kind of advertising <span style="text-decoration: underline;">manipulates children</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">encourages them to pester their parents</span>.</li>

	<p>
				<p>Some students get angry with the IELTS exam. They disagree with the exam format, or they think that examiners are too strict. They often want to suggest their own improvements.</p>

<p>I completely understand that such an important exam can be frustrating, and I agree that the IELTS exam is not perfect. However, I also think that too much worrying is a waste of time.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the exam is what it is. We have to accept that, and work hard to overcome the difficulties. You <em><strong>will</strong></em> pass the exam if you apply yourself, follow advice, and study hard.</p>

	<p>
				<p>These two words are the opposites of 'rise' and 'raise' (see last week's grammar lesson):</p>

<ul>
<li>something falls (e.g. the price fell)</li>
<li>somebody reduces something (e.g. the company reduced the price)</li>
</ul>
<p>You will probably use 'fall' to describe numbers on a graph or chart for IELTS Writing Task 1:</p>

<ul>
<li>In 2008, the number of customers fell. (verb, past)</li>
<li>There was a sharp fall in Internet usage. (noun)</li>
</ul>
<p>'Reduce' and 'reduction' are probably more useful for Writing Task 2:</p>

<ul>
<li>We need to reduce the amount of pollution from exhaust fumes. (verb)</li>
<li>Recycling leads to a reduction in waste. (noun)</li>
</ul>

	<p>
				<p>Here are some questions related to last week's part 2 topic:</p>

<p><em><strong>1. Do you think it's important for boys to play with "boys' toys" and for girls to only play with "girls' toys"?</strong></em></p>

<p>I think boys naturally seem to prefer playing with "boys' toys" and girls with "girls' toys". When I was young I had toy cars, trucks, guns and things like that, whereas my sister always wanted to play with dolls. I don't suppose it really matters if a boy plays with a doll or a girl plays with a toy car, but children learn quickly what toys are supposed to be for boys and for girls.</p>

<p><em><strong>2. Do you think it's good if parents only buy "educational" toys for their children?</strong></em></p>

<p>No, I don't agree with only giving children educational toys. In my opinion, children learn by playing with whatever interests them. Children invent their own games, even if they don't have any toys at all. It's important for children just to have fun; there will be plenty of time for parents to worry about education when their children get older.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Below, you can read an example description of a toy (for IELTS speaking part 2). See yesterday's lesson for the full question.</p>

<p><em><strong>Lego Car Description:</strong></em></p>

<p>One special toy that I remember getting was a Lego car. It was a birthday present from my parents. I can't remember exactly how old I was, but I was probably about 10 or 11.</p>

<p>The special thing about this car was that I had to build it myself out of hundreds of pieces of Lego. The pieces came in a box with a picture of the finished car on the front, and I had to follow step-by-step instructions to put all the pieces together in the correct way. 
<a href="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c0133f2867fbf970b-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Lego8860" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c0133f2867fbf970b " src="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c0133f2867fbf970b-120wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;"></a> This wasn't an easy task because the car even had an engine, movable seats and gears. It took me a day or two to make, and required a lot of concentration.</p>

<p>When the car was finished it looked great, and I felt a sense of accomplishment. I seem to remember that I didn't play with the car very much; the fun part had been the process of building it.</p>

<p><em><strong>Don't just read this description once. Spend some time analysing it:</strong></em></p>

<ul>
<li>Is the description well-organised and easy to follow?</li>
<li>Can you find any good 'band 7' words or phrases?</li>
<li>Could you write a similar description for a different toy?</li>
</ul>

	<p>
				<p>Aida sent me this difficult speaking question:</p>

<p><em><strong>Describe a toy that was special to you when you were a child.<br>You should say:</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>- when you got it<br>- what it looked like<br>- who gave it to you<br>- and how you used it or played with it.</strong></em></p>

<p>If you can't remember a real toy that you had, choose something simple like a toy car (typical boy's toy) or a doll (typical girl's toy). Both of these toys are easy to describe. </p>

<p>I'll write some example ideas about this topic tomorrow. If you have any suggestions, please share them in the "comments" area below.</p>

				<p>Find 5 common mistakes in the paragraph below:</p>

<p>Some people believe that, all police officers should carry a gun. While, others disagree with this idea, and argue that it is intimidating to see armed police officers on the streets. From my view, the advantages of police officers carrying guns have overweighed the disadvantages. Because the police need to be able to protect both themselves and the general public.</p>
