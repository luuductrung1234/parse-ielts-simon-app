	<p>
				<p>It's a good idea to do practice tests (e.g. using the Cambridge IELTS books) in preparation for the listening exam. Here's some advice to help you benefit from doing practice tests:</p>
<p><strong>1. Your score is not the most important thing</strong><br>The important thing is what you have learnt by doing the test. Were there any new words or phrases that you can learn? What did you find difficult? Did any of the questions trick you? In other words, what do you need to do to improve your score?</p>
<p><strong>2. Check how accurate your answers are</strong><br>Be strict with yourself; every grammar or spelling mistake is important. For example, if the speaker says "The library has a collection of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">newspapers</span>", you must <em><strong>not </strong></em>write "collection of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">newspaper</span>".</p>
<p><strong>3. Get into the habit of moving on</strong><br>If you missed something, forget about it and move on. Always prepare for the next question rather than worrying about a previous question. When you are given 30 seconds to check your answers, use the time to look at the next section instead.</p>

	<p>
				<p>If you want to get a better score in IELTS listening, the most important thing is to do lots of listening practice. You need to <em><strong>put in the hours</strong></em>!</p>
<p>To "put in the hours" means "to do the necessary amount of hard work". But let's use this phrase more literally by considering how many practice hours you are actually doing every day or every week. Do you know how many hours you spent listening to English yesterday, or last week?</p>
<p>Maybe you could keep a record of the time you spend listening to English this week, and maybe you can try to increase this listening time next week. A person who listens to 10 hours of English per week is probably going to improve much faster than a person who only manages 30 minutes.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Part 1 is supposed to be the <em><strong>easy part</strong></em> of the listening test. It is almost always a simple gap-fill exercise with basic information about some kind of booking or appointment.</p>
<p><strong>But does this mean that you don't need to practise part 1? No.</strong></p>
<p>I recommend doing lots of practice for part 1. You should be aiming for 10 out of 10 in this part of the listening test because you will probably lose points in parts 2, 3 and 4.</p>
<p>In fact, a good idea would be to focus only on part 1 until you regularly get 10 out of 10. Get as many of the official Cambridge books as you can, and do all of the part 1 questions.</p>
<p><strong>Don't move on to parts 2, 3 and 4 until you master part 1.</strong></p>

				<p>Have you heard about the small changes that have been made to the listening test this year? There's no need to worry, but it's best to be informed!</p>
<p>Here's what the official IELTS website tells us:</p>
<p>..........</p>
<p>From&nbsp;4 January 2020, some small changes are being introduced to the instructions and layout of the paper-based Listening test:</p>
<ul>
<li>We will be changing the word ‘Sections’ to ‘Parts’ – The paper-based test will now be divided into Part 1, 2, 3, 4.</li>
<li>We will be removing the Part 1 example.</li>
<li>We are also removing the page number references.</li>
</ul>
<p>..........</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>Perhaps the only change that may affect you is the second one. You'll need to be ready to start question 1 straight away.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here's the full transcript for the listening exercise in last Tuesday's lesson. The speaker talks quickly, so it's useful to see exactly what she says.</p>
<p class="asset  asset-audio at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c01b8d1c5f1e3970c img-responsive"><a class="inline-player" href="http://ielts-simon.com/files/importance-of-work-experience-1.mp3">Click here to listen</a></p>
<p>I wanted to spend a little bit of time today talking about the importance of work experience as you're considering different management programmes. Now this will vary a lot school by school. So some schools actually will have a minimum number of years of required work experience, so you should enquire with all the schools that you are interested in, sort of, what their recommendations are.</p>
<p>At Stanford specifically, we don't necessarily look at a certain number of years of work experience, but what we’re really looking for are your leadership examples that you’re able to draw from in your life. And as a result, some people actually come to us a little bit earlier on in their careers.</p>
<p>So, most years we might even have, you know, one or two students who come directly after university, but they’ve got incredibly strong leadership examples to draw from: maybe it is from being involved in student government, or clubs, or organisations, or starting a non-profit organisation, or having been involved in a family business growing up. So they’re able to draw and refer to those leadership experiences in the classroom.</p>

<p><strong>A</strong>&nbsp; with a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">drawing</span> of woolly mammoths in their natural habitat<br><strong>B</strong>&nbsp; with a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">timeline</span> showing when woolly mammoths lived<br><strong>C</strong>&nbsp; with a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">video</span> clip about woolly mammoths</p>
<p>22. What was <span style="text-decoration: underline;">surprising about the mammoth tooth</span> found by Russell Graham?</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>&nbsp; It was still <span style="text-decoration: underline;">embedded in</span> the mammoth's <span style="text-decoration: underline;">jawbone</span>.<br><strong>B</strong>&nbsp; It was from an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">unknown species</span> of mammoth.<br><strong>C</strong>&nbsp; It was <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not as old as</span> mammoth remains from elsewhere.</p>
<p>..........</p>
<p>Use the transcript below to answer the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What are the answers to questions 21 and 22 above?</li>
<li>Which keywords in the transcript give us the answers?</li>
<li>Did my underlining in the question choices help?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Martin:</strong> We thought we needed something general about woolly mammoths in our introduction, to establish that they were related to our modern elephant, and they lived thousands of years ago in the last ice age.</p>
<p><strong>Rosie:</strong> Maybe we could show a video clip of a cartoon about mammoths. But that’d be a bit childish. Or we could have a diagram, it could be a timeline to show when they lived, with illustrations?</p>
<p><strong>Martin:</strong> Or we could just show a drawing of them walking in the ice? No, let’s go with your last suggestion.</p>
<p><strong>Tutor:</strong> Good. Then you’re describing the discovery of the mammoth tooth on St Paul’s Island in Alaska, and why it was significant.</p>
<p><strong>Rosie:</strong> Yes. The tooth was found by a man called Russell Graham. He picked it up from under a rock in a cave. He knew it was special — for a start it was in really good condition, as if it had been just extracted from the animal’s jawbone. Anyway, they found it was 6,500 years old.</p>
<p><strong>Tutor:</strong> So why was that significant?</p>
<p><strong>Rosie:</strong> Well the mammoth bones previously found on the North American mainland were much less recent than that. So this was really amazing.</p>

				<p>Multiple choice questions in the listening test are always difficult. I can think of four reasons for this:</p>

<li>There's a lot of information in the question choices, so there's a lot to think about while you're listening.</li>
<li>Some of the choices might be similar.</li>
<li>All of the choices might be mentioned in some way.</li>
<li>Synonyms or paraphrasing may be used instead of the words that you see in the choices.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here's a good example from Cambridge IELTS book 10, page 12.</p>

	<p>
				<p style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">Most students find section 4 of the listening test difficult, and people often ask me for advice about it.</p>
<p style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">The problem is that section 4 is&nbsp;<em><strong>supposed</strong></em>&nbsp;to be difficult: there is no break in the middle, the speaker usually talks quite quickly, and a wide range of vocabulary is used.</p>
<p style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">So, it might seem like strange advice, but I tell my students not to worry too much about section 4. Instead, we do more work on the other three sections. If you get high scores in sections 1 to 3, you don't need many points from section 4.</p>
<p style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">Here are the scores I tell my students to aim for:</p>
<ul style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; list-style-position: outside; list-style-image: none;">
<li>Section 1: 10 correct answers</li>
<li>Section 2: 8 correct answers</li>
<li>Section 3: 7 correct answers</li>
<li>Section 4: 5 correct answers</li>
</ul>
<p style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">As you can see, the total is 30 (band 7), but we only need 5 correct answers for section 4.</p>

	<p>
				<p>The following situation often confuses people:</p>
<ul>
<li>The question asks you for a date</li>
<li>The speaker gives a day, month and year (e.g. 16th July 2019)</li>
<li>But the instruction tells you to answer with <em><strong>one word and/or a number</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p>I agree that this is confusing. However, my advice is simple: write <em><strong>16th July</strong></em> as your answer, without the year. This is the answer that the IELTS people want.</p>
<p>So, make sure you write the day (number) and the month. Only put the year if the question asks for it (e.g. which year...?) or if the instruction allows you to include more than one number.</p>

	<p>
				<p>In my <strong><em>reading</em></strong> lessons I tend to give lots of advice about exam technique. By contrast, my main advice for the <em><strong>listening</strong></em> test is simple: just practise more!</p>
<p>For example, if you find listening section 4 difficult, I doubt that this is because of an 'exam technique' problem. It's probably because the speaker gives a lot of information quite quickly, and <strong><em>your brain isn't quick enough (yet) to keep up with what you hear</em></strong>. There's no technique that will help this "ear to brain" relationship. It's just a matter of practice and exposure to the language.</p>

				<p>How much time did you spend listening to English speakers today? What about yesterday, and the day before?</p>
<p>Maybe, starting tomorrow, you could increase the amount of time that you spend listening to English. Any type of listening practice will help, so I'm not suggesting that you do more IELTS tests. Just watch something interesting on YouTube or listen to a news broadcast - anything to increase your daily listening time.</p>

				<p>Here are two questions that confused some of my students (taken from&nbsp;<em>Official IELTS Practice Materials 2</em>). What are the answers? Can you see why some of my students were 'tricked' into putting the wrong answers?</p>
<p><em><strong>1. Why does Marco's tutor advise him avoid the Team Management course?</strong></em></p>
<p>A) It will repeat work that Marco has already done.<br>B) It is intended for students at a lower level than Marco.<br>C) It may take too much time to do well.</p>
<p><em><strong>2. Why does Marco want to do a dissertation?</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A) He thinks it will help his future career.<br>B) He would like to do a detailed study.<br>C) He has already done some work for it</p>
<p><em>This is what you hear on the recording:</em></p>
<p><strong>Tutor:</strong> The trouble is that because of changes in the content of various courses, Team Management overlaps with the Introduction to Management course you took in your first year. So what you'd learn from it would be too little for the amount of time you'd have to spend on it.</p>
<p><strong>Marco:</strong> I'll drop that idea then. Have you had a chance to look at the outline of my finance dissertation?</p>
<p><strong>Tutor:</strong> Yes. Why exactly do you want to write a dissertation?</p>
<p><strong>Marco:</strong> Well, I'm quite prepared to do the extra work, because I'm keen to investigate something in depth, instead of just skating across the surface. I realise that a broader knowledge base may be more useful to my career, but I'm really keen to do this.</p>

	<p>
				<p>My students found the following two questions difficult, mainly because of some of the vocabulary used by the speaker.</p>
<p>1. Joanna concentrated on women performers because</p>
<p>A) women are more influenced by fashion.<br>B) women's dress has led to more controversy.<br>C) women's code of dress is less strict than men's.</p>
<p>2. Frost's article suggests that in popular music, women's dress is affected by</p>
<p>A) their wish to be taken seriously.<br>B) their tendency to copy each other.<br>C) their reaction to the masculine nature of the music.</p>
<p><em><strong>Here's a transcript of the recording:</strong></em></p>
<p>You only had women performers in your study. Was that because male musicians are less worried about fashion?</p>
<p>I think a lot of the men are very much influenced by fashion, but in social terms the choices they have are more limited... they'd really upset audiences if they <span style="text-decoration: underline;">strayed away from</span> quite <span style="text-decoration: underline;">narrow boundaries</span>.</p>
<p>Frost points out that a lot of female singers and musicians in popular music tend to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">dress down</span> in performances, and wear less feminine clothes, like jeans instead of skirts, and he suggests this is because otherwise they'd just be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">discounted</span> as <span style="text-decoration: underline;">trivial</span>.</p>

	<p>
				<p>How often do you use the 'audioscripts' at the back of the Cambridge IELTS books to analyse listening test answers in more detail?</p>
<p><strong>Here's an example question from Cambridge IELTS 13:</strong></p>
<p>Which TWO things surprised the students about the traffic-light system for nutritional labels?</p>
<p>A&nbsp; its widespread use<br>B&nbsp; the fact that it is voluntary for supermarkets<br>C&nbsp; how little research was done before its introduction<br>D&nbsp; its unpopularity with food manufacturers<br>E&nbsp; the way that certain colours are used</p>
<p><strong>Here's the relevant section of the audioscript:</strong></p>
<p><em>What do you think of the traffic-light system?</em></p>
<p><em>I think supermarkets like the idea of having a colour-coded system - red, orange or green - for levels of fat, sugar and salt in a product.</em></p>
<p><em>But it's not been adopted universally. And not on all products. Why do you suppose that is?</em></p>
<p><em>Pressure from the food manufacturers. Hardly surprising that some of them are opposed to flagging up how unhealthy their products are.</em></p>
<p><em>I'd have thought it would have been compulsory. It seems ridiculous it isn't.</em></p>
<p><em>I know. And what I couldn't get over is the fact that it was brought in without enough consultation - a lot of experts had deep reservations about it.</em></p>
<p><strong>Tasks:</strong><br>- Which two answers do you think are correct, and why?<br>- Which phrases show that the speakers are surprised?</p>

	<p>
				<p>The most difficult thing about the IELTS listening test, in my opinion, is the fact that you only hear the recording once. With this problem in mind, here are some practice tips:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start by ignoring the "once only" problem: when doing practice tests, listen to the recordings twice, three times, or as many times as you need. Just focus on trying to get the right answers.</li>
<li>The next step is to listen once only, but give yourself extra time in the breaks: take as much time as you want to read the questions carefully and underline keywords before you play the recording.</li>
<li>Finally, try doing tests under the normal time constraints. But check your mistakes carefully (using the answers and the transcript) and listen to the recording again to make sure that you can hear the correct answers.</li>

	<p>
				<p>In the listening test it's important to use the breaks well. There are breaks <em><strong>between</strong></em> the four sections of the test, and there are breaks <em><strong>in the middle of</strong></em> sections 1, 2 and 3 (there is no break in the middle of section 4). You will hear instructions like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>First you have some time to read questions 1 to 5.</li>
<li>That is the end of section 1. You now have half a minute to check your answers.</li>
</ol>
<p>1. 'Some time' means about 20 seconds, or up to 40 seconds before section 4. It's important to use this time to read the questions, make sure you understand them, underline key words, and think about what kind of answer is needed (e.g. number, name, noun, verb, singular, plural).</p>
<p>2. Ignore this instruction - don't check a section that you have just finished. It's much more important to be ready for the next section. If you're not ready when the recording starts, you will find it very difficult to read the questions and listen to the answers at the same time. So use this time to read ahead.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Spelling mistakes can affect your score in the listening and writing tests. If you have a problem with spelling, here are some tips:</p>
<ol>
<li>Type your essays: your computer will find your spelling mistakes.</li>
<li>When writing by hand, use a dictionary to check difficult words.</li>
<li>Keep a list: write down any mistakes your computer/teacher finds.</li>
<li>Memorise: learn difficult words by heart.</li>
<li>Test yourself on words you previously spelt wrongly.</li>
<li>Never give your teacher an essay that you haven't checked.</li>

<p>If you find that spelling is a big problem, you should work on it every day. Keep a notebook or put posters on your walls. If you do nothing, you will not improve; there is no secret rule that will suddenly solve the problem!</p>

	<p>
				<p>Multiple choice questions are difficult because there is more to read, and the speaker often mentions more than one of the choices.</p>

<ol>
<li>Try to read the questions and choices before the recording starts.</li>
<li>Don't check your answers to the previous section; use the breaks to read ahead.</li>
<li>Underline key words in each choice. The key words are those that make the difference in meaning between choices.</li>
<li>When listening, only look at the words you underlined. Don't read everything again.</li>
<li>Expect the trick! They often mention more than one choice, so be careful.</li>
<li>If you're not sure, make a good guess, then move on to the next question.</li>
<li>If you don't have time to read everything (tip 1), don't worry. Prepare as many questions as you can, then do your best on the others.</li>

	<p>
				<p>If you're practising with the Cambridge IELTS books, you'll find audioscripts (written versions) of the recordings at the back of the books. I recommend that you read and analyse these in order to gain a better understanding of what the speakers said.</p>
<p><strong>Let's look at two example questions from Cambridge IELTS 12:</strong></p>
<p><em>21. What will be the main topic of Trudie and Stewart's paper?</em></p>
<p><em>A) how public library services are organised in different countries</em><br><em>B) how changes in society are reflected in public libraries</em><br><em>C) how the funding of public libraries has changed</em></p>
<p><em>22. They agree that one disadvantage of free digitalised books is that</em></p>
<p><em>A) they may take a long time to read</em><br><em>B) they can be difficult to read</em><br><em>C) they are generally old</em></p>
<p><strong>Here's the part of the audioscript that contains the answers:</strong></p>
<p>(Trudie) <em>Maybe we should concentrate on this country, and try to relate the changes in libraries to external developments, like the fact that more people can read than a century ago..... We're only supposed to write a short paper, so it's probably best if we don't go into funding in any detail.</em></p>
<p>(Stewart) <em>But the digitalised books that are available online for free are mostly out of copyright, aren't they? And copyright in this country lasts for 70 years after the author dies. So you won't find the latest best-seller or up-to-date information</em>..... (Trudie) <em>That's an important point</em>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Task:</strong></em><br>What are the correct answers to the two questions, and which 'keywords' gave you those answers?</p>

				<p>People often ask me about spelling, capital letters and plurals. Here's my advice:</p>

<li>Correct spelling is very important. I know students who have lost up to 10 points in their IELTS listening tests because of spelling mistakes.</li>
<li>Capital letters, on the other hand, are <em><strong>not</strong></em> important. You can write all of your answers in capitals or in lower case - it won't affect your score.</li>
<li>Plurals are very important. e.g. If the question asks you to fill the gap "There are many ______", the answer could be "reasons" but not "reason".</li>
</ol>

<p><em><strong>Tip:</strong></em> The real learning happens when you find a difficult part. Perhaps the speaker suddenly goes too quickly, or seems to join a group of words together. You might need to listen several times; you might even need help to hear what the speaker is saying. This is the kind of hard work that you should be looking for!</p>

	<p>
				<p>Most people find multiple choice sections difficult. If you want to improve your scores on these sections, here's the key skill that I think you should work on:</p>
<p><strong>Identifying differences</strong></p>
<p>If you can't see a clear difference in meaning between each of the choices (e.g. answers A, B and C), you'll be lost before the recording even starts.</p>
<p>Try this exercise:</p>
<ol>
<li>Take a multiple choice section from one of the listening tests in the official Cambridge IELTS books.</li>
<li>Spend some time reading the answer choices for each question.</li>
<li>Try to identify a clear difference between each choice.</li>
<li>Underline one or two key words in each choice. Choose words that highlight the differences that you identified.</li>
<li>Make sure that you have found and underlined clear differences, so that you know exactly what to listen for.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The exercise above involves no listening practice. Identifying differences is about reading and understanding.</p>

				<p>Last week I asked you to try transcribing (writing down) what the speaker says in the 1-minute recording below. If you've done this, compare your transcription with mine below. Did you make any mistakes?</p>

<p><strong>Transcript:</strong></p>
<p>It is much easier for humans to understand information when it is structured. In fact, we remember information up to 40% better when it's structured.</p>
<p>I have lots of favourite structures. You see some of the structures up here behind me. The first structure is a chronological structure (past, present, future): Here’s how things used to be, here’s how they are today, here’s where they’re going in the future.</p>
<p>A chronological structure can really help you navigate your audience from one place to the next. Quite frankly structure sets expectations. You can't be lost if you have a map. Your structure provides a map, and the chronological structure is incredibly helpful for that.</p>
<p>The next structure happens to be the ‘problem, solution, benefit’ structure. This is one of the most persuasive structures out there. You start by explaining what the issue is, you talk about how to solve it, and then the benefits to the people.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong><br>You will never see a transcription exercise in an IELTS test. It's just a good way to work on your listening skill.</p>

	<p>
				<p>I've just watched the following presentation about better communication. I was planning to create a quick vocabulary exercise about it, but I've changed my mind. I think we can learn a lot more than just vocabulary from this speaker.</p>
<p>If you have time to do some 'real work', here's what I suggest you could do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Watch the video once, all the way through. What was the main message that you took from the presentation after listening once?</li>
<li>Watch again, and take notes on the content of the talk. What does the speaker say about: 1) approach 2) audience 3) context 4) structure?</li>
<li>What other communication techniques does the speaker use? For example, why does he begin the talk by saying "people hate me"?</li>
<li>Focusing on the part about 'structure', do you notice any similarities with the 'structures' that I recommend for IELTS speaking and writing?</li>
<li>Finally, perhaps you could compile a list of the good collocations and phrases that the speaker uses. His talk is full of good language.</li>
</ol>
<p>The video is 16 minutes long, but I think you could spend hours studying it. I hope to read your ideas in the 'comments' below.<br><span style="color: #ffffff;">mm</span></p>

<li>in the corner</li>
<li>beside</li>
<li>ahead of you</li>
<li>opposite</li>

<li>where the path bends</li>
<li>near</li>
<li>just after</li>
<li>cross the bridge</li>
<li>walk through the field</li>

				<p>Multiple choice sections are difficult because there's so much to read before you listen to the recording.</p>

<p><strong>Part of the recording:</strong></p>
<p>Now you may have heard that this can be a stressful job, and I have to say that can be true. You'll be working an eight-hour day for the first week, though you'll have the chance to do overtime after that as well if you want to. But however long the hours are, you'll get a break in the middle. What you will find is that you're on your feet all day long, lifting and carrying, so if you're not fit now you soon will be! You'll find you don't have much chance to take it easy - when someone tells you to do something, you need to do it straightaway - but at least we do have a very efficient air conditioning system compared with some kitchens.</p>

<p>The correct answer is B, but many students put A because they hear the word "everyone".</p>
<p><strong>2. The speaker says: "early afternoon".</strong></p>
<p>If there is a gap-fill question, you must write "early afternoon". If you write "afternoon", your answer will be marked wrong.</p>

	<p>
				<p>People often ask me whether compound nouns should be written as one word or two. For example, do we write <em><strong>seafood</strong></em> or <em><strong>sea food</strong></em> and <em><strong>clubhouse</strong></em> or <em><strong>club house</strong></em>?</p>
<p>Before reading the article that I shared in yesterday's lesson, I didn't have a good way to answer the question above. I didn't know that an easy rule existed.</p>
<p>Look again at the following three rules for compound nouns:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">For nouns with two syllables, like <em><strong>break-up</strong></em> and <em><strong>set-to</strong></em>, the rule is easy: use a hyphen only when the second word has two letters.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">If the second part of the word has more than two letters, it should be spelled as a single word, like <em><strong>coastline</strong></em> or <em><strong>bedroom</strong></em>.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">if the noun has three or more syllables, it is two separate words e.g. <em><strong>bathing suit</strong></em> and <em><strong>washing machine</strong></em>.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">These rules tell us that <em><strong>seafood</strong></em> and <em><strong>clubhouse</strong></em> should be written as one word (rule 2). Can you find any more examples in the IELTS listening tests that you have done?</span></p>

	<p>
				<p>Here's my transcription of the recording from last week's listening <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2018/06/ielts-listening-one-minute-transcription.html">lesson</a>:</p>
<p>Critical thinking is all about asking questions, the right questions, questions that help you assess both the meaning and the significance of claims and arguments. Building these skills and applying them in your life makes it easier for you to assess evidence, evaluate arguments and adapt your thinking so you stay switched on and engaged in different situations.</p>
<p>Critical thinking involves stepping back from a situation to enable you to see all the angles before making judgements or taking decisions. It means identifying the key points, analysing the sources of information, weighing up different types of evidence - just as a judge and jury would do in a court of law - and putting it all together into your own independent thought-through point of view.</p>
<p><strong>Tip: note down the following useful vocabulary:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the meaning and significance of something</li>
<li>assess / evaluate claims, arguments, evidence</li>
<li>build skills, apply skills in your life</li>
<li>adapt your thinking</li>
<li>stay switched on</li>
<li>stay engaged</li>
<li>step back from a situation</li>
<li>see all the angles</li>
<li>make judgements</li>
<li>make / take decisions</li>
<li>identify key points</li>
<li>weigh up the evidence</li>
<li>an independent point of view</li>
<li>a thought-through point of view*</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>*thought-through</em></strong> is an adjective here. It means that the person has thought carefully about his/her point of view. He/she has thought it through.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Someone recently asked me about test 2, question 27 in Cambridge IELTS 7. The answer to this question is "1882 to 1883", but the student thought he heard "1892 to 1893". Students in my classes have often made the same mistake.</p>
<p>So, why do people hear 1892 when the speaker says 1882?</p>
<p>The reason is that you hear the letter 'n' at the end of '18' e.g. eightee-<strong>n</strong>-eighty-two. If the speaker is talking quickly, it might sound like the 'n' is the first letter of the number that comes after 18.</p>
<p>However, you should ignore this 'n' because it is simply the last letter in the word "eighteen". Instead, you need to hear the "ei" vowel sound in "<strong>ei</strong>ghty" instead of the "ai" sound in "n<strong>i</strong>nety". For me, the difference between 1882 and 1892 is very clear, because I hear a completely different vowel sound.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Last Tuesday I asked you to think about how to deal with difficult multiple choice exercises, particularly in section 3 of the listening test. People shared some great tips in the comments area below the <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2018/04/ielts-listening-section-3-multiple-choice.html">lesson</a>, and I'll try to summarise their advice (and mine) here.</p>
<p>First, some general practice tips (when practising at home, not in the test)</p>
<ol>
<li>Do as much multiple choice practice as you can.</li>
<li>Practise multiple choice questions <strong><em>in isolation</em></strong>. In other words, when you're working on multiple choice exercises, don't do any other type of question; work <em><strong>ONLY</strong></em> on multiple choice.</li>
<li>Create your own <em><strong>collection</strong></em> of multiple choice exercises. For example, if you have several of the Cambridge IELTS books, you could photocopy all of the multiple choice sections and put them together in one document. This will make it easier to follow tip 2 above.</li>
</ol>
<p>Analyse your performance very carefully</p>
<ol>
<li>Listening, understanding and following: Try listening to each multiple choice recording <em><strong>without</strong></em> looking at the questions. Stop the recording any time you don't understand something or feel that you're not really following what the speaker is saying. Before you worry about the questions, it's a good idea to assess your own listening ability in this way; perhaps your ability to understand and follow fast speech needs work.</li>
<li>If you have problems when you listen without the questions (point 1 above), you need to increase the amount of general listening practice that you do. In other words, your brain needs more exposure to the English language.</li>
<li>If you don't have a problem with understanding and following (point 1 above), you can start doing the practice exercises below.</li>
</ol>
<p>Add variety to your practice. Here are some possible practice exercises:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do multiple choice sections without any preparation time at all, and see how well you do.</li>
<li>Try the opposite of exercise 1: give yourself plenty of time to read and fully understand each question and all of the choices.</li>
<li>Allow yourself to underline only <em><strong>one</strong></em> key word in each question and in each choice. See if you can get the answers by focusing on those key words only.</li>
<li>Allow yourself to listen to the recording more than once. Did you get the right answers the second time or the third time?</li>
<li>After each exercise, analyse any difficulties that you had, and identify the exact points where you went wrong.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, here are some <em><strong>test tips</strong></em> (i.e. what to do during the exam)</p>
<ol>
<li>Try to get <em><strong>ahead of time</strong></em>. Several people commented that they start reading the section 3 multiple choice questions during the breaks in sections 1 and 2. If you're really confident with the first two sections, this is a good idea.</li>
<li><em><strong>Underline or circle</strong></em> just one or two key words in each question and in each choice. When listening, try to focus only on those key words.</li>
<li>Remember to listen for <em><strong>synonyms and paraphrasing</strong></em>. You won't always hear the exact words from the questions or choices.</li>
<li>Have <em><strong>the next question in mind</strong></em>. Keep an eye on the key words for the question below the one that you're trying to answer.</li>
<li>Keep your mind on the task, and make sure you're <strong><em>following</em></strong> the recording.</li>
<li><strong><em>Touch your pen</em></strong> on any key words that you hear, and keep confirming that you are in the right place.</li>
<li>If you miss something, <em><strong>move on and find your place</strong></em> as quickly as possible by listening for a key word.</li>
</ol>
<p>Quick summary: do lots of practice, experiment with exam techniques, and analyse everything!</p>

	<p>
				<p>A couple of weeks ago, in <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2018/04/ielts-listening-section-4.html">this lesson</a>, I said that section 4 was the most difficult part of the listening test. But several people wrote comments below the lesson telling me that they found section 3 to be the most difficult.</p>
<p>The problem with section 3 is that it often contains a big multiple choice exercise. Here are a few reasons why multiple choice questions are so tricky:</p>
<ul>
<li>There's so much information to read. You might not have time to read all of the questions and choices before the recording starts.</li>
<li>It's easy to get 'lost' as you listen to the recording and try to assess the different choices for each question. Your brain is doing too much multitasking!</li>
<li>Sometimes the choices are very similar, and you will probably hear at least one key word from each choice. Unless you listen very carefully, you might be 'tricked' into making the wrong choice.</li>
<li>The speaker may say something but then contradict it in the next sentence (another type of 'trick').</li>
</ul>
<p>So how can you deal with all of these problems? How can you <strong><em>train yourself</em></strong> to be better at the multiple choice questions in section 3?</p>
<p>Feel free to share ideas or ask questions in the comments area below this lesson. I'll read the comments, take the best tips, and add my own advice; I'll give you my <strong><em>multiple choice training</em></strong> tips next Tuesday.</p>

	<p>
				<p>For multiple choice questions in the listening test, try to underline just one or two keywords in each choice before the recording starts. It's much easier to focus on the difference between each choice if you've underlined the right keywords. Here's an example (from Cambridge IELTS 10):</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p>What helped Rob to prepare to play the character of a doctor?</p>
<p>A) the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">stories</span> his grandfather told him<br>B) the times when he <span style="text-decoration: underline;">watched</span> his grandfather working<br>C) the way he <span style="text-decoration: underline;">imagined</span> his grandfather at work</p>
<p><strong>Transcript of Rob speaking:</strong></p>
<p>I have to write about the role I played, the doctor, how I developed the character. My grandfather was a doctor before he retired, and I just based it on him. He must have all sorts of stories, but he never says much about his work. I'd visualise what he must have been like in the past, when he was sitting in his consulting room listening to his patients.</p>
<p><strong>Answer?</strong></p>
<p>Notice that all three choices (A, B and C) are about the grandfather, so the keywords that I underlined are <em><strong>stories</strong></em>, <em><strong>watched</strong></em> and <em><strong>imagined</strong></em>. Which is the right answer?</p>

	<p>
				<p>Section 4 is the most difficult part of the listening test for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no break in the middle of the 10 questions</li>
<li>You hear one speaker giving a fairly long talk or lecture</li>
<li>The speaker will speak quite quickly</li>
<li>A wider range of vocabulary is used, compared to the other sections</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's my tip: Don't worry too much about this section. Spend most of your time practising sections 1, 2 and 3.</p>
<p>Try to get as many points from the other three sections as you can, and this will allow you to lose points in section 4. Remember that you can make 10 mistakes and still get a band 7.</p>

				<p>The people who do well in the listening test are those who have a "good ear" for English. In other words, they are able to follow fast speech and distinguish individual words easily. How did they develop a good ear? They listened to a lot of English.</p>
<p>If you're trying to improve your listening score, stop searching for techniques! Spend your time listening to as much English as possible. Expose your ears to the language and they will gradually become better at hearing it.</p>

				<p>If you have any of the books that contain practice IELTS tests (e.g. the official Cambridge books), why not use the listening test answers to check your spelling? Here's what you could do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask a friend or family member to read the listening test answers (at the back of the book). Write each answer down, then check whether you made any spelling mistakes.</li>
<li>Or, record yourself reading the answers aloud, then listen to the recording and try to spell each word correctly. To make this more difficult, test yourself with the recording a week later.</li>
</ul>

<p>What is a microplastic? It's the tiny particle created when larger plastic items - tooth brushes, bottles, bags - break down over decades. They float in the water and get eaten by sea life.</p>
<p>They cause two problems. First, the fragments act like a sponge to other toxins in the water - pesticides and flame retardants, for example - suctioning them up and concentrating them.</p>
<p>Secondly, they are themselves complex polymers - molecules the body can’t fully break down. When they get really tiny, into a billionth of a metre as a nano-plastic, scientists have shown they can cross tissue membranes into fish cells. They say that is harmful to fish, their reproduction, immunity, survival skills.</p>
<p>What we don't know is what happens when humans eat the fish or sea life. Is it harmful to us? It's already an urgent question. A leading US government scientist told CNN plastic is definitely in our food chain and drinking water. This isn’t something maybe happening to our children; it’s already here.</p>

	<p>
				<p>In my opinion, online videos are a revolutionary tool for language learners and teachers. If you want to work on your listening, there's no end to the practice that you can do.</p>
<p>Here are three quick tips on using online videos:</p>
<p><strong>1. What should you watch?</strong><br>Almost any English listening practice is good because it all helps to improve your 'ear'. But I recommend that you choose videos on topics that you find interesting - you'll be more likely to keep watching and note down vocabulary if you enjoy what you're watching.</p>
<p><strong>2. Short videos (under 5 minutes)</strong><br>I often use short videos in my lessons. If the video is short, we can watch it several times and take all of the good language from it. If you watch a video that is under 1 minute long, try transcribing it and aim to understand every word.</p>
<p><strong>3. Longer videos (over 5 minutes)</strong><br>If you watch a longer video, don't worry too much about understanding every word or phrase; just try to follow the overall message. Note down only the most useful words or phrases that stand out.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Of course, the advice that I gave in yesterday's reading lesson also applies to listening. If your only listening practice comes in the form of IELTS listening tests, or other listening exercises from English language courses, I don't think you'll progress as quickly as you could.</p>
<p>Your brain needs to hear <em><strong>a lot</strong></em> of English before it can comfortably process what native speakers are saying. This is why I felt like a beginner when I <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2017/10/ielts-advice-knowledge-vs-skill.html">went to France</a>, even though I had studied French at school for seven years.</p>
<p>Just imagine how many hours of listening practice you've had in your own language over the years!</p>
<p>If you're serious about learning English, creating a <em><strong>daily listening habit</strong> </em>could be the most important thing that you do.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Sometimes you have to label a diagram in the listening test. For example, the diagram below comes from Cambridge IELTS book 7.</p>
<p><a href="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c015438887b97970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Picture 1" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c015438887b97970c image-full" src="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c015438887b97970c-800wi" title="Picture 1"></a></p>
<p>Many students miss the answers for this type of question because they get "lost" on the diagram. They don't know where to look.</p>
<p>There is one simple technique to avoid this problem: whenever you see a diagram, <em><strong>look for the question numbers</strong></em>. You will always hear the answers in the correct order, so your eyes should go to the first question number first, then move around the diagram following the numbers.</p>
<p>For the question above, your eyes should be looking at the bottom of the picture (question 11) when the recording starts, and your ears should be listening for "stop B".</p>

	<p>
				<p>Perhaps the biggest danger in the listening test is that you get stuck on a difficult question, and consequently you miss some of the following questions too. In some cases, one question can cause people to lose their place completely and make a mess of the whole section.</p>
<p>Here are three tips that should help you to avoid this situation:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use the breaks to read ahead and underline keywords in each question.</li>
<li>While you're listening for the answer to one question, try to keep an eye on a keyword from the next question too.</li>
<li>If you miss an answer, forget about it and immediately move on to the next question. Don't guess the answer at this stage - you can guess any answers that you missed in the 10 minutes that you are given at the end of the test.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Remember:</strong> There will be some difficult 'band 8 and 9' questions in every listening test. It's not a problem if you miss these questions or get them wrong. But it is a problem if you get stuck and also miss some easy questions that followed the difficult ones.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Perhaps the hardest thing about the IELTS listening test is that you only hear the recordings once. If you miss something, there's no second chance.</p>
<p>However, when practising or when listening to anything in English at home, I recommend that you listen to the same thing several times. Every time you listen again, you'll probably hear something new, and your listening skills will improve more quickly than they would if you only listened to everything once.</p>
<p><strong>Here's a good listening exercise:</strong></p>
<p><strong>- Listen to the same short recording several times.</strong><br><strong>- But each time you listen, focus on something different.</strong></p>
<p>For example, first focus on the meaning or the overall message, then listen for the answers (if you're using an IELTS test), then listen to verb tenses, then listen to the speaker's pronunciation, then listen to the little words like articles and prepositions etc. etc.</p>
<p>Your "ear" will improve more quickly through repetition and through the kind of <strong><em>deep listening</em></strong> that the exercise above encourages. Try it yourself!</p>

				<p>A good way to improve your listening skill is to transcribe short recordings. For example, I'm sure you could manage to transcribe one minute of English every day.</p>
<p>Here's what you could do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Take any recording of English speakers that you find on the Internet, or use an IELTS test. I recommend using news programmes, documentaries, or any part of an IELTS test (section 4 might be the best for this exercise).</li>
<li>Listen to the first minute of the recording only. Listen to it once without writing anything.</li>
<li>Listen to the first minute again, and try to transcribe (write down) everything that you hear. Listen as many times as you need to, until you have the full transcription on paper.</li>
<li>Check your transcription by turning on the subtitles option on the video (most video websites now have this), or by checking at the back of the book, if you're using an IELTS test.</li>

	<p>
				<p>Here are 4 techniques that you could experiment with when practising IELTS listening tests from the Cambridge books:</p>
<ol>
<li>Work on specific sections rather than doing full tests. For example, you could focus on section 1 this week, then do lots of examples of section 2 next week.</li>
<li>Do a full test, but allow yourself to listen two or three times. See how many extra answers you get the second or third time you listen to the recording.</li>
<li>Do a full test, but give yourself as much time as you want during the breaks (by stopping the recording). This takes away the problem of not having time to read the questions properly, and allows you to focus more on your listening skills.</li>
<li>Change the listening test into a reading test. Instead of listening to the recording, use the transcript at the back of the book. Did you get a higher score than usual? If you did, your listening skills need more work. If you didn't, maybe your problem is related to vocabulary.</li>
</ol>
<p>The suggestions above might help you to find where your weaknesses are. They might also make exam practice a bit more interesting!</p>

<p>Today I'm going to answer the question “Why should I hire you?”, exactly the way I do in my book ‘The Complete Interview Answer Guide’. Now, this is often the last question you will be asked in an interview. Prepare for it. I mean, this is your chance to restate the skills you possess that are most relevant to the position, and to summarise your other qualities that make you the perfect person for the job.</p>
<p>I want you to outline your answer before you go in, and so that you can answer clearly, concisely and with confidence. Your answer should be short, to the point; it should reflect your profession, your background as it relates to your current needs and the problems of the position. Review the job description and tell them how you are the right person for the job by matching up your skill set with each bullet point for the job description. In formulating your answer, be sure to address these areas:</p>
<p>Number 1: Determine their goals for the position. This should come up during your research into the company and the position. If possible talk to others who work for the company. If you're unclear on this point, include it in the questions you ask the interviewer, and be prepared to incorporate it into your answer.</p>
<p>Also, show them that you have the skills needed for the job. Based on the goals you've identified in step 1, determine how your skills and experience support these goals, and if necessary, you know, just refer back to your list of skills.</p>
<p>Thirdly, articulate shared values. Again, this should come up in your research. Look at the company's mission statement and regular business practices. Explain why these are in line with your own values and goals.</p>

<p>For over a decade as a doctor, I've cared for homeless veterans, for working-class ___1___. I've cared for people who live and work in ___2___ that can be hard, if not harsh, and that work has led me to believe that we need a ___3___ different way of looking at healthcare. We simply need a healthcare system that moves beyond just looking at the ___4___ that bring people into clinics, but instead actually is able to look and improve health where it begins. And where health begins is not in the four ___5___ of a doctor's office, but where we live and where we work, where we eat, sleep, learn and play, where we spend the ___6___ of our lives.</p>

				<p>Last week I asked you which words you would underline in the questions below. Now let's see if we can get the correct answers, using only the underlined keywords.</p>
<p><em><strong>Here are the questions again, with keywords underlined:</strong></em></p>
<p>1. How might a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">guest feel</span> when staying in a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">luxury hotel</span>?</p>
<p>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">impressed</span> with the facilities<br>B&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">depressed</span> by the experience<br>C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">concerned</span> at the high <span style="text-decoration: underline;">costs</span></p>
<p>2. According to recent research, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">luxury hotels overlook</span> the need to</p>
<p>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; provide for the demands of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">important guests</span><br>B&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; create a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">comfortable environment</span><br>C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; offer an individual and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">personal welcome</span></p>
<p>3. What is the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">impact</span> of the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">outside environment</span> on a hotel guest?</p>
<p>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">considerable</span> effect.<br>B&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has a very <span style="text-decoration: underline;">limited</span> effect.<br>C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has <span style="text-decoration: underline;">no effect</span> whatsoever.</p>
<p><em><strong>Now here's the transcript of the recording. Choose the correct answers and explain them by referring to keywords in the questions and transcript.</strong></em></p>
<p>You wake up in the middle of the night in a strange hotel miles away from home, disoriented most probably from jet lag, when even the most expensive surroundings can seem empty and dispiriting. The research suggests that even the most opulent, luxurious hotels seem to have underestimated the most basic needs of their customers - be they travelling for work or pleasure: the need to feel at home in surroundings which are both familiar and inviting. And the research concluded that what was outside the hotel building simply didn’t matter.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Before the recording starts, you should use the breaks to read through the questions and underline the key words that you'll need to listen for.</p>
<p>But don't underline too many words. For example, if I told you that you could underline only <em><strong>one or two</strong></em> key words in each of the choices (A, B and C) below, which words would you choose?</p>
<p>1. How might a guest feel when staying in a luxury hotel?</p>
<p>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; impressed with the facilities<br>B&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; depressed by the experience<br>C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; concerned at the high costs</p>

<p>For centuries people have been able to improve their lifespans through dietary changes, public health policies and other factors. However, a recent study from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine has found that the limits of human longevity may have already been reached. In fact, researchers believe the maximum lifespan likely peaked decades ago, around 1995.</p>
<p>According to a news release issued by the school, the team used two different data sets, the ‘Human Mortality Database’ and the ‘International Database on Longevity’, as the basis for the study. Based on their calculations, they concluded that humans can typically live a maximum of 115 years, but the absolute upper limit is likely 125 years.</p>
<p>And while they acknowledge that medical breakthroughs could increase the average life expectancy, researchers believe the maximum will likely remain unchanged. As such, they suggest that efforts should focus on improving the health and quality of life, instead of trying to live longer.</p>

<p>The use of photographic film was pioneered by George Eastman, who started manufacturing paper film in 1885, before switching to celluloid in 1889. His first camera, which he called the <em>Kodak</em>, was offered for sale in 1888. It was a very simple and relatively low-priced box camera aimed at the average consumer. The Kodak came with enough film for a hundred exposures and needed to be sent back to the factory for processing when the roll was finished.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here's the full transcript for my most recent listening <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2016/08/ielts-listening-why-is-the-sky-blue.html">exercise</a>:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why is sky blue?</span></p>
<p>Well, first we need to understand a little bit about how light works. When light travels from the sun, it moves up and down like a wave, similar to the waves you see on the ocean. Some waves are close together and others are further apart. The distance between each bump in a wave is called wavelength, and when all of the different wavelengths travel together, light appears white to our eyes. But if you break up sunlight so that the waves are separated, you will see individual colours. In fact, every colour has its own unique wavelength. Bluish colours have a short wavelength and move up and down more often than a colour like red, which has a longer wavelength.</p>
<p>So if light from the sun contains all of these different colours, why does the sky appear blue? Well, it also has to do with the way these waves interact with the atmosphere. If there were nothing between the sun and our eyes, the sun would look like a white circle in a black sky. But the atmosphere gets in the way and changes the way the light behaves. While the atmosphere may seem like a large empty space, it is actually made up of a whole bunch of tiny little particles like air molecules, water, and dust. Light waves are tiny too, so when they finally reach the atmosphere they have a hard time dodging the small particles in the sky. The shorter wavelengths of light, like blue and violet, move up and down so much they tend to interact with the particles more often than other colours. These colours get bounced around so much they spread through the atmosphere and fill the sky. Even though purple light is also scattered out across the sky, our eyes are more sensitive to blue light, and so the sky appears more of a bluish colour. Red, yellow, and green coloured lightwaves bounce around too, but not as much, and more of this light passes through. When these colours are mixed together, they appear a yellowish-white, which is why the sun looks somewhat yellow to our eyes.</p>
<p>So now you know when you look at a blue sky you are actually looking at a portion of sunlight that has been broken up and scattered by billions of tiny particles.</p>

	<p>
				<p>I often talk about the importance of looking for "keywords" or "similar words" in the reading test, but the same advice applies to many questions in the listening test.</p>
<p>Look at the following question from Cambridge IELTS 4:</p>
<p><em><strong>Which argument was used against having a drama theatre?</strong></em></p>
<p>A) It would be expensive and no students would use it.<br>B) It would be a poor use of resources because only a minority would use it.<br>C) It could not accommodate large productions of plays.</p>
<p><em><strong>Find the answer by looking for the "similar words" in the transcript below.</strong></em></p>
<p>There was, however, much disagreement about whether to build a drama theatre. Just over forty per cent of the respondents were in favour, but a largish minority were strongly against it, claiming that it is elitist and a waste of funds.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here's the full transcript for the 'brain foods' exercise that I put on the blog a few weeks ago.</p>
<p class="asset  asset-audio at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c01b8d20e5b3f970c img-responsive"><a class="inline-player" href="http://ielts-simon.com/files/brain-foods-1.mp3">Click here to listen</a></p>
<p>A complete and balanced diet is probably the most sound advice. But some specific types of food are especially good for brain health. Here are a few of the best:</p>
<p><strong>Fish:</strong> The original brain food contains lots of omega-3 fatty acids and fish oils, especially cold-water fish like salmon and cod. Omega-3s are beneficial in a number of ways, including promoting neuronal growth, improved cholesterol, and fortification of myelin sheaths which facilitate communication between neurons.</p>
<p><strong>Vegetables:</strong> These are a great source of antioxidants, which may reduce the risk of developing cognitive impairment by diminishing oxidative stress. Spinach, Brussels sprouts, broccoli and cauliflower are among the top candidates.</p>
<p><strong>Fruits:</strong> Like vegetables, fruits are rich in antioxidants; however, fruit tastes better. Some of your healthiest options are blueberries, blackberries, cranberries, strawberries, raspberries, plums, avocados, oranges, red grapes, red bell peppers, cherries and kiwi.</p>
<p><strong>Water:</strong> Be sure to get enough to keep your body and brain hydrated. Dehydration can cause a headache now, and can lead to long term neuronal damage sustained from elevated stress hormones.</p>
<p><strong>Chocolate:</strong> Last and arguably least beneficial are cocoa beans which contain the flavonol epicatechin and antioxidants. Dark chocolate is best, and avoid candy bars with lots of added sugars. Also, recent research suggests that chocolate can improve memory.</p>

				<p>People often ask me the following question:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the instruction says that you can use more than one word, "book shop" and "sea food" would be accepted.</li>
<li>However, if the instruction tells you to use only one word, you must write "bookshop" or "seafood". If you write two words, it's wrong!</li>

He also understood the importance of learning in a group or _____, learning from others that are _____ you. The essence of a democracy is that you have different _____ and you learn from each of them, and Dewey celebrated that. He would probably be _____ of the current system of education because it ignores the teaching _____ and what each student brings to the classroom.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Yesterday I talked about the importance of underlining in the reading test. Do you also underline key words in the listening test? I think you should.</p>
<p>During the breaks in the listening test, read ahead and underline the <em><strong>main</strong></em> words in each question.</p>
<p><em><strong>Example:</strong></em> Which words would you underline when preparing for the following gap-fill exercise?</p>
<ol>
<li>According to the schedule, the meeting will take place at _____.</li>
<li>The decision will mean that full-time employees are allowed to _____ for free.</li>
</ol>
<p><em><strong>Tip:</strong></em> Don't underline too many words. I would underline just 2 words in the first example above, and 6 words in the second example. Can you guess which?</p>

<p>The fact is, multitasking is a _____. Our brains can't do it. You simply become less efficient and more distracted, your error rate goes up 50 per cent, and it takes you twice as long to do the same task. Listen what Tim Jenkins has to say. He’s the co-_____ of Point B, a leading business consulting firm.</p>
<p>Well I think there’s a _____ out there, that folks that can multitask are more effective. There are times when it's just important to focus on one thing. I think we also need to give people permission to check out, to check out of the communications _____ temporarily to get things done; because when you're always on, when you're always online, you're always distracted, right, and the brain really is telling us that that is a very unproductive _____ to be in. So the always online organisation is actually the always unproductive organisation.</p>

<p><strong>1) Lots of information</strong><br>Yes. We had five choices to think about, and the relevant part of the recording was quite long.</p>
<p><strong>2) Similar choices</strong><br>Yes. The choices contained two types of swimming pool.</p>
<p><strong>3) All of the choices mentioned</strong><br>Yes. Both pools, the gym, and sports training for children were mentioned. "The tracks" (which usually means running tracks) were not really mentioned, but the word "lanes" may have confused some people.</p>
<p><strong>4) Synonyms or paraphrasing</strong><br>the gym = fitness suite<br>tracks = could be similar to "lanes"<br>indoor / outdoor pool = there isn't space for an outdoor pool<br>training for children = children benefit from tuition</p>

<p><em>Before we start our tour of the club, I'll just run through some basic information about the facilities we have here, including recent improvements, and explain the types of membership available.</em></p>
<p><em>Our greatest asset is probably our swimming pool, which at 25 metres isn't Olympic-sized, but now we've expanded it to eight lanes, it's much wider. This means there are rarely more than a couple of people at a time in each lane. Unfortunately, there isn't space for an outdoor pool here, but the glass roof on the swimming pool is partly retractable, which means you can enjoy something of the open-air experience on warmer days.</em></p>
<p><em>Our recently refurbished fitness suite has all the latest exercise equipment, including ten new running machines and a wide range of weight-training machines. Each member is given full training in how to operate the equipment, and there is always a trainer on duty to offer help and advice. Although we do have adult-only times after 6 and at certain times at weekends, children are well catered for. Older children continue to benefit from a wide range of tuition: anything from trampolining to yoga.</em></p>

<p>Try transcribing one of the recordings on this website, an online video, or a section of a real test in one of the Cambridge books. Imagine how quickly your listening would improve if you did a short transcription every day!</p>

				<p>Yesterday I repeated my overall advice for the reading test, so now here's my list of advice and techniques for IELTS listening:</p>
<ol>
<li>Concentrate - it's really easy to miss the answers if you lose concentration, even for a moment.</li>
<li>Read ahead - it's more important to be ready for the next section than to check the questions you have already done (check them at the end when you have 10 minutes to transfer your answers).</li>
<li>Highlight key words - when reading ahead, it's a good idea to underline words that you think you will need to listen for.</li>
<li>Have the next question in mind - when you're listening for the answer to a question, be ready for the next question as well. It's easy to miss several answers if all of your focus is on one question.</li>
<li>Expect 'tricks' - the speaker may try to confuse you -&nbsp;<a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2014/03/ielts-listening-tricks.html" target="_self" title="">click here</a> to see an example.</li>
<li>Spelling - as well as testing your understanding and vocabulary, IELTS Listening is also a spelling test. You must work on your spelling if this is a weakness.</li>
<li>Difficult questions - don't worry if some questions seem really difficult. The exam needs to have questions that separate band 8 from band 9. If you are worrying too much, you might miss the easier questions that could get you a band 7.</li>

	<p>
				<p>When you hear the 'keywords' from the question, you can usually expect to hear the answer just after them. However, sometimes the speaker has already said the answer <em><strong>before</strong></em> you hear the 'keywords'. Here's an example to show you what I mean:</p>
<p><strong>Question (from Cambridge IELTS 7):</strong><br>Undiscovered material may be damaged by ______.</p>
<p><em>When listening to the recording, you are waiting to hear the keywords "undiscovered material" and "damaged by", and you are hoping to hear the answer <strong>after</strong> hearing those keywords.</em></p>
<p><strong>This is what you hear:</strong><br>Don't make fires, however romantic it may seem. It's really dangerous in dry areas, and you can easily burn priceless undiscovered material by doing so.</p>
<p><em>Can you see that the answer came <strong>before</strong> the keywords "undiscovered material"? What is the correct answer?</em></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong><br>There isn't a special technique to help you with this type of question; you just need to be aware that you might have heard the answer before you hear the 'keywords'.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Yesterday I suggested a study technique for the IELTS reading test. Of course, you can use the same technique for listening practice:</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose one section from an official test.</li>
<li>Get the correct answers from the back of the book.</li>
<li>Listen to the recording with the aim of understanding why each answer is correct. Listen more than once if necessary.</li>
<li>Write the key vocabulary in a table or in your notebook.</li>
</ol>
<p>This technique is particularly useful for listening section 4. Give it a try!</p>

				<p>When I was learning languages (French and German) at school, the only listening practice I got was when the teacher spoke or when she played short recordings on a tape recorder!</p>
<p>The current generation of language learners don't know how lucky they are! They have the Internet at their disposal, with access to millions of videos, podcasts, audiobooks etc. They have the chance to immerse themselves in the language for hours every day. Are you taking advantage of this?</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here are some common questions that people ask me about the listening test, with my answers below each one.</p>
<p><em><strong>1. What is the best way to write a date?</strong></em></p>
<p>There is no best way, and all normal ways of writing dates are accepted e.g. 7th April, 7 April, April 7th etc.</p>
<p><em><strong>2. What is the best way to write a time?</strong></em></p>
<p>Again, as long as the time is correct, it shouldn't matter too much how you write it. You can write 9am, 9.00am, 9:00 am etc.</p>
<p><em><strong>3. Do we need to include articles ('a' or 'the') before nouns?</strong></em></p>
<p>Usually you don't need the article. If the answer is a noun, just write that word. However, if you need to fill a gap in a sentence, the grammar should be correct, so you may need an article. If you're unsure, write the article that you hear.</p>
<p><em><strong>4. Are correct use of capital letters and singular/plural important?</strong></em></p>
<p>I've answered that question in a previous lesson - <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2014/07/ielts-listening-capital-letters-and-plurals.html" target="_self" title="">click here</a>.</p>
<p><em><strong>5. Should we write "bookshop" or "book shop"?</strong></em></p>
<p>I mentioned the problem of words like "bookshop" and "seafood" in <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2013/10/ielts-listening-one-word-or-two.html" target="_self" title="">this lesson</a>.</p>

	<p>
				<p>In section 4 of the listening test, the speakers often use synonyms and paraphrasing, rather than the exact words from the questions.</p>
<p>Here's a keyword table for section 4 of test 4 in Cambridge book 5:</p>

	<p>
				<p>The advice I gave yesterday about reading is also appropriate for listening. While it's important to do test practice, it's just as important to listen to as much 'real' English as possible. This is the only way to improve your ear.</p>
<p>For real listening practice, I recommend starting with news programmes, documentaries and presentations or 'talks'.</p>
<p>For example, here's a TED talk that I watched yesterday:</p>

	<p>
				<p>In the first 3 sections of the listening test, you will <em>mostly</em> hear the words that you see in each question. However, when you get to section 4, it becomes more difficult. The speakers will use more synonyms and paraphrasing, rather than the exact words from the questions.</p>
<p>Here's a keyword table for section 4 of test 2 in Cambridge book 8:</p>

<p>My class consists of second and third graders who have a wide range of abilities and needs. I am always assessing my students by observing them in large groups, questioning them in their small groups, and looking closely at the work they record in their folders.</p>
<p>My method of teaching is called ‘Differentiated Instruction’ and it involves considering the needs of individual learners in my class, rather than targeting somewhere around the middle of the group.</p>
<p>Learning is an incredibly complex process, involving so many different factors for every individual; multiply that by 25 children in the class and it can feel like an overwhelming responsibility. But my goal is to teach every child, to get them to a common destination by whatever route they need to get there. I believe that by using the method of Differentiated Instruction, every child will get there.</p>

				<p>Here are two common questions about the IELTS listening test:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is it acceptable to use lower case instead of upper case e.g. "central station" when the answer is "Central Station"?</li>
<li>Will you lose marks if you miss the "s" when the answer should be plural?</li>
</ol>
<p>Here are my answers:</p>
<ol>
<li>Using lower case is fine, so "central station" would be correct. You can even write everything in capital letters if you want.</li>
<li>Missing the "s" is sometimes acceptable and sometimes not. It's <em><strong>not</strong></em> acceptable when the grammar requires a plural e.g. "the journey takes three <span style="text-decoration: underline;">hour</span>" would be wrong. Some answers can be singular or plural. Check the context of the question and the sentence grammar carefully.</li>

	<p>
				<p>As well as doing IELTS listening test practice, anything else that you listen to in English will help to improve your 'ear'. I recommend using websites like YouTube for daily listening practice: choose a topic that you find interesting, and search for videos about it.</p>
<p>For example, I'm interested in language learning (of course!). Here's a YouTube video that I found and watched yesterday:</p>
<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/ikZY6XpB214?rel=0" width="420"></iframe></p>
<p>If you found this video interesting, watch it a second time and note any new or useful phrases that you hear. If you didn't find it interesting, search for something different. As the speaker says at the start of the film, the key is to expose yourself to as much "comprehensible input" as possible!</p>

<p>The first thing any regular train user should do is to book their tickets in advance, _____ exactly 12 weeks in advance. Those £300 tickets to Manchester, you can get them for just £25 return if you go online. You go to a website called thetrainline.com, you fill in their ticket _____ system, and you’ll get an email telling you when those tickets are available. Because they often _____ _____ very quickly, so when you get that email, act straight away.</p>
<p>But, and I know this sounds a bit sneaky, don’t actually buy them on thetrainline.com, because you’ll have to pay a £1.50 booking fee, and if you’re using your credit card another £1.50. Instead, _____ over to the East Coast website - you’d think that’s only trains down the East coast from London up to Edinburgh - it’s not; they will sell tickets for any trains anywhere in the UK, and they don’t charge a booking fee, and they don’t charge for credit card. So that’s another two or three _____ saved.</p>
<p>If you haven’t been able to buy a ticket a long _____ in advance, it is still worth remembering that up until 6 o’clock on the night before, you can still get Advance tickets. They won’t be as cheap as the Super-Advance ones, 12 weeks in advance, but it’s still _____ trying to buy them the night before.</p>

<p><em><strong>A) potential leaders.<br>B) open to new ideas.<br>C) good at teamwork.</strong></em></p>
<p>This is what Janice says:</p>

<p>As you can see, all three of the choices are mentioned. You really need to concentrate for this kind of question - don't just write the first thing you hear.</p>

<p>There are several things that we know about really effective teachers. One of them is that the most effective teachers have the largest number of metaphors and the largest number of examples to choose from, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">they’re the best at choosing the right ones</span>, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">techniques at the right moment</span>. So, really expert teachers - I think <span style="text-decoration: underline;">it helps to be old</span> in this, you know, or to learn from people who’ve been around for a while - really excellent teachers have a vast store of ‘moves’ (if we think of them as chess players) that they can go to in a given situation. And so the more moves you have, you know, the more arrows in your quiver, the more likely you are to be able to get through those sorts of moments. But again, just moving makes a difference for students in being able to pay attention, and it’s also a way of signalling when you’re going to change up.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Most students find section 4 of the listening test difficult, and people often ask me for advice about it.</p>
<p>The problem is that section 4 is <em><strong>supposed</strong></em> to be difficult: there is no break in the middle, the speaker usually talks quite quickly, and a wide range of vocabulary is used.</p>
<p>So, it might seem like strange advice, but I tell my students not to worry too much about section 4. Instead, we do more work on the other three sections. If you get high scores in sections 1 to 3, you don't need many points from section 4.</p>
<p>Here are the scores I tell my students to aim for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Section 1: 10 correct answers</li>
<li>Section 2: 8 correct answers</li>
<li>Section 3: 7 correct answers</li>
<li>Section 4: 5 correct answers</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, the total is 30 (band 7), but we only need 5 correct answers for section 4.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Many students get low scores in IELTS listening because they make spelling mistakes. Here are some tips to improve your spelling:</p>
<p><strong>1. Make a spelling list</strong><br>Every time you make a spelling mistake, write the correct spelling of the word on a list. Hopefully the list of words that you can spell correctly will grow and grow.</p>
<p><strong>2. Learn by heart</strong><br>The only way to make sure that your spelling improves is to learn words by heart. Learn the words on your spelling list, and test yourself once a week.</p>
<p><strong>3. Rules don't help very much</strong><br>You could easily get  lost in the labyrinth of English spelling rules. It's easier to remember the spelling of individual words than it is to remember all the rules.</p>
<p><strong>4. Get a dictionary 'app' for your phone</strong><br>Do you look up words in a dictionary at least once a day? Having a dictionary application on your phone makes it easy. The Merriam-Webster dictionary app for the iPhone is a good one (and it's free).</p>

	<p>
				<p>The video below is about climate change. I think it's useful for three reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>The style (academic, formal) is quite similar to IELTS listening section 4.</li>
<li>The description of a graph is useful for IELTS writing task 1.</li>
<li>The film contains some great vocabulary for the environment topic (IELTS writing task 2 and IELTS speaking).</li>
</ol>
<object height="344" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/S9ob9WdbXx0&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1?rel=0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"><embed allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/v/S9ob9WdbXx0&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1?rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425"></object>

<p><em><strong>Listen and fill the gaps in the summary:</strong></em></p>

<p>The graph helps us to distinguish between variations in the climate due to ______ causes and those variations that are induced by human ______.</p>

<p>The climate is naturally variable. Occasionally there is a downward trend that is associated with a volcano going off. Then we get to a period, from about 1910, where you can start to see an upward trend, a warming of the climate: ______ ______.</p>

<p>Up to this point, you could argue that climate variation can be explained by natural ______. That is no longer the case as you get to the latter part of the 20th century. From about 1970 onwards, you can see the red curve and the green curve beginning to diverge. The yellow curve includes human factors: in particular the ______ effect, which is mostly caused by carbon dioxide from ______ fuel burning.</p>

<p>There seems little doubt that this steep rise in temperature is due to human activity. Without the action of ______ ______, there would have been far less ______ change since the 1970’s.</p>
