	<p>
				<p>As I'm sure you know, we normally place the adjective in front of the noun in English e.g. "the red car" instead of "the car red".</p>
<p>However, English is a crazy language, and rules are there to be broken!</p>
<p>If you read yesterday's lesson (and clicked on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postpositive_adjective">this link</a>), you may have seen the following examples of noun + adjective:</p>
<ul>
<li>someone important</li>
<li>somewhere nice</li>
<li>the best <em><strong>room available</strong></em></li>
<li>the only <em><strong>decision possible</strong></em></li>
<li>the worst <em><strong>choice imaginable</strong></em></li>
<li>the <em><strong>person responsible</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Remember:</strong> The 'rules' that you find in an intermediate (or even 'advanced') grammar book are probably a simplification. There are deeper levels to be discovered!<br></p>

	<p>
				<p>There was an interesting discussion in the comments below Wednesday's <a href="https://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2020/02/ielts-writing-task-2-from-plan-to-paragraph.html">lesson</a> about the phrase <em><strong>"I can buy any product imaginable"</strong></em>.</p>
<p>Here's a summary of the questions in that discussion:</p>
<p>1) Why did I write <em><strong>any product <span style="text-decoration: underline;">imaginable</span></strong></em> instead of <strong><em>any</em> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">imaginable</span> product</strong>?<br>2) Would <em><strong>any imaginable product</strong></em> also be correct?<br>3) Is there a difference in meaning between the two phrases?</p>
<p>I'll try to answer without going deep into grammar, but if you really like the grammar side of things, have a look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postpositive_adjective">this page</a> (especially the part about 'the only decision possible' and 'the worst choice imaginable').</p>
<ol>
<li>The simple answer is that "any product imaginable" sounds better to me as a native speaker. This phrase isn't my own original creation; I've probably heard or read it many times in similar contexts, so it's the instinctive phrase to use.<br><strong>Note:</strong> There are 14,300 Google search results for this collocation.</li>
<li>While "any imaginable product" is also grammatically correct, it seems just a little less natural to me. The emphasis is slightly different, and the meaning could also be understood in a slightly different way.<br><strong>Note:</strong> There are only 905 Google search results for this collocation.</li>
<li>This is debatable. If I had to give you my view, I would say that an "imaginable product" could include products that don't currently exist (e.g. a flying car), whereas my phrase "any product imaginable" tends to refer to products that currently exist.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the end, the Google results and my instinct as a native speaker are probably your best guide. In normal English usage, "any product imaginable" is the typical collocation.</p>

				<p>I was reading The Economist yesterday, and I noticed these sentences:</p>
<p>America's total student debt<span style="background-color: #bfbfff;">, at over $1.5trn,</span> is <span style="background-color: #bfbfff;">larger than</span> the national borrowing of most countries. <span style="background-color: #bfbfff;">It</span> has <span style="background-color: #bfbfff;">quintupled</span> in size since 2004, <span style="background-color: #bfbfff;">overtaking</span> <span style="background-color: #bfbfff;">both</span> borrowing on credit cards <span style="background-color: #bfbfff;">and</span> car finance.</p>
<p>I've highlighted a few useful features in the two sentences:</p>
<ol>
<li>adding a statistic between two commas using "at"</li>
<li>a comparative: larger than</li>
<li>cohesion (referencing) using the pronoun "it"</li>
<li>quintupled = increased fivefold</li>
<li>overtaking: you may be able to use this word when describing a graph</li>
<li>comparing and contrasting using "both... and..."</li>
</ol>

<p>My reply is always this: You should be happy! An improvement of half a band is great, and it shows that you are on the right track.</p>

	<p>
				<p>All students learn to link ideas using words like "however", "furthermore" etc. Most students don't realise that the word "this" is also a linking word. Look at the following examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nowadays, people can use the Internet to work from home. In <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">this</span> way, people who do not have access to transport can find employment.</li>
<li>Most products are built to last only a short time, and <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">this</span> creates a "throw-away" culture.</li>
<li>A global economy means free trade between countries. <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">This</span> can strengthen political relationships.</li>
</ul>
<p>The word "this" refers to the sentence or idea that came before. "This" helps you to link ideas and avoid repetition. Native speakers and good writers use "this" a lot, and the IELTS examiner will be impressed if you can use it.</p>

	<p>
				<p>I studied French at school for seven years, and my teachers helped me to accumulate quite a lot of <em><strong>knowledge about</strong></em> the language.</p>
<p>However, when I visited France I still felt like a beginner. I found it difficult to understand native speakers, and I couldn't speak naturally; I had to construct sentences in my head before I spoke, and I was constantly worried about making mistakes. In short, I had knowledge but <strong><em>not much skill</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Do you feel like this when you speak or write in English? Maybe it's time to stop <em><strong>studying</strong></em> English and start <em><strong>practising</strong></em> it as much as possible!</p>

	<p>
				<p>You won't have time to do this in your test, but it's a good idea to edit and improve the essays that you write at home.</p>
<p>For example, in the <a href="https://www.ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2020/01/ielts-writing-task-2-music-essay.html">music essay</a> that I shared on Wednesday, there's a phrase that we could improve: <strong>"the planet's global language"</strong>.</p>
<p>While this phrase is fine and wouldn't affect the essay's score, you could argue that it contains repetition because 'planet' and 'global' communicate similar meanings. Note: We could simply write "the planet's language" or "the global language", but I wanted to use this structure: noun + adjective + language.</p>
<p>So let's think about some possible alternatives:</p>
<ol>
<li>the planet's shared language</li>
<li>the planet's common language</li>
<li>humanity's global language</li>
<li>our global language</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice that I changed the adjective 'global' in the first two examples, I used a different noun (humanity) in example 3, and I used a pronoun instead of the noun 'planet' in example 4. Which alternative do you prefer?</p>

	<p>
				<p>A student asked me about the phrase <strong>"I was hoping that you could help me"</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Why do we use the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">past</span> tense (was hoping) if we're asking for help <span style="text-decoration: underline;">now</span>?</em></p>
<p><strong>Here's the answer that I gave the student:</strong></p>
<p>I know it seems strange, but this is a common way to ask for something in English. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>I was hoping that you could help me = I hope you can help me.</li>
<li>I was hoping to get your advice = Can you give me your advice?</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps you could think about it like this: the "hoping" happened in my head before I decided to ask for the help.</p>
<p>Or you could just see this as a fixed phrase, and a typically English way to ask politely and indirectly!</p>

	<p>
				<p>Many students seem to think that the following is true:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">long, complex sentences = difficult = high score</p>
<p><strong><em>But this isn't necessarily correct</em></strong>. First, long sentences are just short sentences (or clauses) that have been linked together, so it's not difficult to write them. Second, you won't get a high score if your long sentences are full of mistakes.</p>
<p>The best writers use a mix of <em><strong>long and short</strong></em> sentences. This is the ideal style to aim for because it makes your writing 'smoother', more varied, and easier to read.</p>

<li>Analyse <em><strong>one</strong></em> grammar or vocabulary mistake that you made, and understand the correction.</li>
<li>Analyse <em><strong>one</strong></em> mistake in a reading or listening test, and understand why you got the answer wrong.</li>
<li>Learn <em><strong>one</strong></em> new word, collocation or phrase.</li>
<li>Learn how to express <em><strong>one</strong></em> idea in a 'natural' way. Find out how a native speaker would say it.</li>
<li>Prepare ideas, opinions and vocabulary for <em><strong>one</strong></em> IELTS topic.</li>
<li>Read <em><strong>one</strong></em> sample band 9 essay, and highlight anything useful e.g. vocabulary, cohesive devices, how ideas are developed.</li>
<li>Write <em><strong>one</strong></em> paragraph and get it checked by a teacher.</li>
<li>Record yourself doing <em><strong>one</strong></em> speaking test. Transcribe the recording and analyse the transcription or get it checked by a teacher.</li>

<p><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Source: Cambridge IELTS 14)</span></p>
<p><strong>Here's my band 9 sample answer:</strong></p>
<p>The bar chart and table give information about a country's export earnings from five groups of products in 2015 and 2016.</p>
<p>It is noticeable that export revenues in all but one of the five product categories increased over the period shown. While petroleum products were the highest earning exports in both years, the textile industry saw the most significant growth in earnings.</p>
<p>Export earnings from petroleum products rose from around $61 billion in 2015 to $63 billion in 2016, which was an increase of 3%. Income from engineered goods reached a similar level. The country’s export earnings from these goods went up by 8.5% to approximately $62 billion in 2016.</p>
<p>From 2015 to 2016, there was a 15.24% increase in export revenue from textiles, with earnings rising from roughly $25 billion to over $30 billion. By contrast, there was almost no change in the amount of money earned from agricultural products, which remained at just over $30 billion. Finally, the only decline in income occurred in the gems and jewellery product group, where export earnings fell by around 5% to approximately $40 billion in 2016.</p>

<ul>
<li>work on a different aspect of your writing e.g. coherence</li>
<li>record yourself speaking and listen to your hesitations</li>
<li>analyse the correct answers to a reading test, instead of doing the test</li>

	<p>
				<p>Here are my corrections for the sentences in yesterday's lesson.</p>
<p>1. "There are many reasons to believe why" is a clumsy phrase. Instead, write:</p>
<p>- There are many <em><strong>reasons why</strong></em> this is detrimental.<br>- There are many <strong><em>reasons why I believe that</em></strong> this is detrimental.<br>- I believe that this is detrimental for several reasons.</p>
<p>2. They have an impact on young <em><strong>adult<span style="text-decoration: underline;">s'</span></strong></em> health. (plural possessive)</p>
<p>3. We need to use the <em><strong>uncountable</strong></em> (not plural) form of the word <em><strong>exercise</strong></em>. We're talking about 'exercise' in general, not a specific number of exercises.</p>
<p>- The number of people doing physical <em><strong>exercise</strong></em> is falling.</p>
<p>4. "By spending hours on television" is a problematic phrase because "on television" is usually used when we're talking about the people who <em><strong>appear on</strong></em> TV. For example, if you say "I was on television yesterday", it means that you appeared on a TV programme. To avoid confusion, we need to write:</p>
<p>- By spending hours <strong><em>watching</em></strong> television...<br>- We lead a sedentary life because we spend so many hours <em><strong>watching</strong></em> TV.</p>

<p>Would you compare the chart and table, or describe them separately?</p>
<p><em><strong>The chart below shows the value of one country's exports in various categories during 2015 and 2016. The table shows the percentage change in each category or exports in 2016 compared with 2015.</strong></em></p>

<p>Here's a third tip: Think about personal examples or stories.</p>
<p>So, do you have a personal example or story about how the arts have affected your life? I'm sure you remember a special experience, such as seeing a famous painting, attending a wonderful concert, or reading a great work of fiction. Practise telling your story!</p>

<p><em><strong>What do the arts contribute to our lives?</strong></em></p>
<p>I gave two tips that can help you to think of vocabulary ideas.</p>
<p><strong>1) Start by thinking of examples to make the topic (the arts) more real.</strong></p>
<p>- Paintings e.g. in the National Gallery in London<br>- Music e.g. live concerts and performances<br>- Theatre e.g. a Shakespeare play</p>
<p><strong>2) Then think about the topic from different perspectives.</strong></p>
<p>- <strong>Personal:</strong> enjoyment, inspiration, enrich our lives, capture our imagination<br>- <strong>Cultural:</strong> heritage, national identity, connection to the past<br>- <strong>Economic:</strong> employment, boost the economy, attract visitors, tourism</p>
<p>Some of the students shared many more ideas, and they seemed to find the 'perspectives' idea useful. Try it yourself.</p>

<p><strong>Change the following 'past description' into a future description.</strong></p>

	<p>
				<p>In the latest lesson on my <a href="https://ieltssimon.substack.com">member site</a>, I talked about the problem of using synonyms. For example, if you're describing a chart that shows percentages of poverty, you might think that you need to use synonyms of the word <em><strong>poverty</strong></em> in your answer.</p>
<p>If you look for synonyms of 'poverty' in a dictionary, you'll find words like:</p>
<p><em>destitution, pennilessness, deprivation, impoverishment, pauperism</em></p>
<p>Unfortunately, these words will seem <strong>forced and unnatural</strong>. Also, you don't have access to a dictionary in your test, and it's unlikely that you would have these words in your head.</p>
<p>My advice in the video lesson was this: Add variety by using <em><strong>collocations</strong></em> instead of synonyms. For example:</p>
<p><strong>Collocations with the word poverty:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>poverty rates</li>
<li>levels of poverty</li>
<li>below the poverty line</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Collocations with the adjective (poor) instead of the noun (poverty):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>poor people</li>
<li>people who were classed as poor</li>
<li>poorer individuals</li>
</ul>
<p>In the academic test, this is the best way to reduce repetition and to add variety to your task 1 answers.</p>

<p>As I write this blog post, I'm not thinking about grammar, and I don't have any pre-prepared words or phrases that I'm hoping to use. My only aim is to communicate a message, and my only task, in terms of language, is to choose the right words in order to deliver my message clearly.</p>
<p>Try this yourself when you're speaking or writing in English. Push all of your worries out of your mind e.g. grammar, impressing the examiner, your score, what you've studied etc.</p>
<p>Instead, just focus on two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>The message that you want to communicate.</li>
<li>Choosing your words carefully to deliver that message.</li>

	<p>
				<p>You might assume that mistakes affect only your grammar score. But some mistakes are <em><strong>vocabulary</strong></em> mistakes. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>a spelling mistake</li>
<li>a word formation mistake (e.g. incorrect formation of a past participle)</li>
<li>a word choice mistake (e.g. inappropriate or unnatural use of a word)</li>
</ul>
<p>For me, <em><strong>word choice</strong></em> is the big one. If you want to be a good writer, even in your own language, word choice is the skill that you need to develop. Interestingly, we refer to the greatest writers, like Shakespeare, as <em><strong>'wordsmiths'</strong></em> due to their mastery of word choice.</p>
<p>So, the next time you're writing in English, try to imagine yourself as a 'wordsmith'. Think about the different vocabulary options that you have, and make word choice your priority as you write.</p>
<p>I'll be going deeper into this aspect of the writing test in the next few video lessons on my <a href="https://ieltssimon.substack.com">member site</a>.</p>

	<p>
				<p>In last week's grammar lesson on my <a href="https://ieltssimon.substack.com">member site</a> I highlighted some key mistakes in a student's task 1 answer. The most important mistake involved the student's use of the word 'while'.</p>
<p>The student wrote something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Spending on salaries rose<strong>. While,</strong> spending on resources fell.<br></em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Note: the student used 'while' incorrectly between two simple sentences)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The correct version would be this:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Spending on salaries rose<strong>, while</strong> spending on resources fell.<br></em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Note: the correct version is a complex sentence)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The student made three similar mistakes with the word 'while', and I gave the answer a band 6 for grammar. If the student had written three correct 'while' sentences, I would have given a 7 for grammar.</p>
<p>I call this type of mistake a <strong><em>'sticking point'</em></strong> because it keeps you stuck on a lower band. In this case, the 'while' mistake is important because the student missed the opportunity to create three complex sentences.</p>
<p>Ask a teacher to help you to look for 'sticking points' in your writing. Getting past these sticking points could be the fastest route to a higher score.</p>

				<p><em><strong>The table below gives information about changes in modes of travel in England between 1985 and 2000.</strong></em><br><span style="color: #ffffff;"><em><strong>m</strong></em></span></p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #ffffff;">a</span><br>Here's my full sample answer. We'll analyse it next week.</strong></p>
<p>The chart shows average distances that people in England travelled using different forms of transport in the years 1985 and 2000.</p>
<p>It is clear that the total number of miles travelled by English people using all modes of transport increased significantly between 1985 and 2000. The car was by far the most used form of transport in both years.</p>
<p>In 1985, the average person travelled 3,199 miles by car, and this rose to 4,806 miles in the year 2000. The figures for miles travelled by train, long distance bus, taxi and other modes also increased from 1985 to 2000. Travel by taxi saw the most significant change, with more than a threefold increase from 13 miles per person per year in 1985 to 42 miles in 2000.</p>
<p>There was a fall in the average distances for three forms of transport, namely walking, bicycle and local bus. In 1985, English people walked an average of 255 miles, but this figure fell by 18 miles in 2000. Bicycle use fell from 51 to 41 miles over the period shown, while the biggest downward change was in the use of local buses, with average miles per person falling from 429 to 274 over the 15-year period.</p>

	<p>
				<p>I sometimes receive questions from students about the '<a href="https://www.examenglish.com/vocabulary/academic_wordlist.html">academic word list</a>'. Here's what people want to know:</p>
<p><em><strong>Is this list useful for IELTS preparation?</strong></em></p>
<p>The short answer (in my opinion) is <strong>no</strong>. I've never used the academic word list with IELTS students.</p>
<p>Here's a longer answer:</p>
<p>Of course there are lots of useful words on the academic word list, and it would be great if you knew all of them. But remember: <em><strong>understanding is not the same as using</strong></em>. You would need to spend time learning how to <em><strong>use</strong></em> the words correctly in phrases and sentences. Furthermore, the list contains only individual words; you need to build your knowledge of phrases and collocations, and the list doesn't help you with that.</p>
<p>If you're preparing for IELTS, I think you have other priorities: test practice, exam techniques, question types, topic vocabulary, phrases and collocations, reducing grammar mistakes etc. Unless you have <em><strong>a lot</strong></em> of study time, I wouldn't include the academic word list in your study schedule.</p>

				<p>Here's my answer to the task in yesterday's lesson: the method was fine, but the language can be improved.</p>
<p><strong>The method is fine:</strong><br>The student wrote the introduction in the way that I recommend: the first sentence introduces the topic, and the second sentence answers the question.</p>
<p><strong>But there are some language problems (underlined below):</strong><br>There are different views <span style="text-decoration: underline;">regarding on question that</span> should children be punished to learn the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">discrepancy</span> between <span style="text-decoration: underline;">wrong and right</span>.

<p><strong>Here's my improved version:</strong><br>People have different views <span style="text-decoration: underline;">with regard to the question of whether</span> children should be punished in order to teach them the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">difference</span> between <span style="text-decoration: underline;">right and wrong</span>. In my opinion, simple or 'soft' punishments are a necessary tool for parents and teachers as they raise and educate children.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em><br>Sometimes people make 'mistakes' in their choice of vocabulary. For example, in English we say "the difference between right and wrong", not "the discrepancy between wrong and right". This is not a grammar mistake, it's a collocation mistake.</p>

<p>Here are two 'overview' paragraphs for the table above. Which do you prefer? What 'technique' did I use when writing them?</p>
<p><strong>Overview 1</strong><br>It is clear that the car was by far the most used mode of travel in both years. Overall, English people travelled significantly more in 2000 than in 1985.</p>
<p><strong>Overview 2</strong><br>It is clear that the total number of miles travelled by English people using all modes of transport increased significantly between 1985 and 2000. The car was by far the most used form of transport in both years.</p>

<p>People suggested two sensible places to add this detail.</p>

	<p>
				<p><strong>Here's my full description of the <a href="https://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2019/08/ielts-writing-task-1-process-diagram.html">fish pie process diagrams</a>:</strong></p>
<p>..........</p>
<p>The pictures illustrate the ingredients that go into a factory-made fish pie, and the various steps in its production.</p>
<p>The pie contains salmon, peas, sauce and potatoes, and there are ten stages in its manufacture, from delivery to dispatch. One of the ingredients, potato, goes through its own six-stage preparation process before it can be added to the pie.</p>
<p>Potatoes are the first ingredient to be prepared on the production line. They are delivered to the factory up to a month before the process begins, and they must be cleaned, peeled and sliced. Potato peelings are thrown away, and the sliced potatoes are boiled, then chilled and stored.</p>
<p>When fresh salmon arrives at the factory, lemon juice and salt are added, and the fish is cooked in a steam oven within 12 hours of delivery. Next, factory workers remove and dispose of the skin and bones, and the fish is inspected. Following inspection, pre-prepared peas, sauce and potatoes are added. The resulting fish pies are wrapped, frozen and then stored or dispatched.</p>
<p>(175 words, band 9)</p>
<p>..........</p>
<p><em><strong>Task:</strong></em> I forgot to mention that the fish pie is in a microwaveable container. Where could you add this information in my answer?</p>

				<p>Last <a href="https://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2019/08/ielts-advice-your-learning-environment.html">Sunday</a> I asked for your comments regarding the following question:</p>
<p><em><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; -moz-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">How can you improve your environment so that it accelerates your learning?</span></em></p>

Here are a few of my own tips:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">First, it's important to realise how important your environment is. If you live and work with native English speakers and you're surrounded by the English language all day, you're going to improve much more quickly than someone who studies English from a book for one hour each day. </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">Knowing that the 'native speaker' environment is the ideal, try to set up your environment so that it is a close to this ideal as possible.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">Second, I recommend finding an environment that challenges you. If you attend a course of English lessons, for example, it shouldn't be an easy course. You need to feel like you're learning something useful in every lesson, and your teacher should be highlighting your mistakes and pushing you to perform better.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">Third, I think it helps if you feel that you're part of a community of learners who have shared goals. By following this blog, you are already doing this to some extent.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">Finally, use the Internet to get as much language 'input' as you can. Even if you're studying alone, you have access to a world of English content online. You can probably also find people to talk to and practise with.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">Here's a shorter answer: Surround yourself with as much English as you can, and take every opportunity to practise what you learn.</span></p>

	<p>
				<p>What's the fastest way to improve your English?</p>
<p>Well, in my opinion the answer is this: <em><strong>put yourself in the best possible English language environment.</strong></em></p>
<p>Studying alone is a slow, hard journey. But if you can find a way to surround yourself with English speakers, or a community of English learners, you'll make faster progress and the journey won't seem so arduous.</p>
<p>If you're feeling stuck or isolated as you learn English and prepare for the IELTS test, perhaps you need to find an environment or community that can carry you forward.</p>

	<p>
				<p>When describing process diagrams, many people struggle to write a good overview or summary of the information.</p>
<p>Have another look at the task that I shared last week:</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c0240a4a8cfea200d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Doc Sep 03  2019  20_43" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c0240a4a8cfea200d img-responsive" src="https://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c0240a4a8cfea200d-500wi" style="width: 460px;" title="Doc Sep 03  2019  20_43"></a></p>
<p><strong>Here's my 2-sentence overview, summarising the information:</strong></p>
<p>The factory-made fish pie contains four ingredients, and there are ten stages in its production, from delivery to dispatch. One of the ingredients, potato, goes through its own six-stage preparation process before it can be added to the pie.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Many students ask how long it will take to get from an intermediate level (maybe IELTS band 5) to an advanced level (band 7).</p>
<p>If you were learning to play the piano, would you expect to go from intermediate to advanced in a few weeks? Would you expect to find a special technique that suddenly makes you an advanced pianist? The answer is no. Most people know that they would need to work hard and practise every day to get to an advanced level on the piano.</p>
<p>In my opinion, learning a new language is a similar challenge. You should aim to make small, gradual improvements because it isn't realistic to expect sudden changes.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Yesterday I told you that my examiner friend and I advise students not to use the word 'plethora' in their essays. Why not? Well, for a plethora ;) of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plethora means 'many'. If you write that there are a plethora of reasons and then give only one or two reasons, you've used the word wrongly.</li>
<li>The word plethora seems too exaggerated, pompous or pretentious for an IELTS essay. It doesn't suit the 'measured' academic style that we're aiming for.</li>
<li>If the rest of your essay is written in a more basic style, a word like plethora will stand out as strange and unnatural.</li>
<li>If you attempt to use 'impressive' words but your essay is full of mistakes, it is obvious to the examiner that you're trying to show off. When surrounded by grammar mistakes, a word like plethora looks even more unnatural.</li>
<li>I'm a native speaker, and I would only use the word plethora if I really wanted to exaggerate something, or to sound pretentious on purpose (perhaps for humorous effect). I wouldn't use it in an academic essay.</li>
<li>Finally, plethora is an example of what I call an <em><strong>'any essay</strong> <strong>word'</strong></em>. Students learn words like this because they hope to use them in any essay, regardless of the topic. In other words, these students are trying to 'trick' the examiner into being impressed - this doesn't work. If you want to impress the examiner, you should focus on specific <a href="https://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2019/05/ielts-vocabulary-topic-specific-vocabulary.html">topic vocabulary</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope this convinces you to stop learning words like plethora. Just write "there are several reasons" or "there are two main reasons" and then focus on describing them. Leave the pompous language to politicians!</p>

	<p>
				<p>Too many students (and teachers) waste time worrying about the 'complex structures' aspect of the grammar score in the writing test.</p>
<p>From what I've seen when marking essays, 99% of students are able to write sentences with more than one clause, using words like <strong><em>and, but, because, while, which, if...</em></strong> to connect ideas. Therefore, they are able to meet the requirement for 'complex structures'.</p>
<p>On the other hand, many of the same students are <strong><em>not</em></strong> able to produce <em><strong>frequent error-free sentences</strong></em> (band 7), and it's rare for me to see essays in which <strong><em>the majority of sentences are error-free</em></strong> (band 8).</p>
<p>So, if people can't produce error-free sentences, why are they worrying about complex structures? In most cases, the key to a high grammar score is <strong><em>fewer mistakes</em></strong>, not more complex sentences.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Cambridge IELTS 13)</span></p>
<p>The maps illustrate some changes that were made to a city hospital's transport infrastructure between the years 2007 and 2010.</p>
<p>It is noticeable that three main modifications were made to the hospital’s vehicle access. These involved the building of a new bus station, new roundabouts and new parking facilities.</p>
<p>Looking at the changes in more detail, we can see that in 2007 there were three bus stops on either side of Hospital Road. These were no longer present in 2010, and instead we see the addition of a bus station on the west side of Hospital Road. This bus station is accessed via two new roundabouts; the first roundabout is at the intersection of City Road and Hospital Road, while the second is at the other end of Hospital Road, at the junction with the hospital ring road.</p>
<p>The two maps also show that changes were made to public and staff parking areas. In 2007, staff and visitors used the same car park, which was situated to the east of Hospital Road and accessed via the ring road. However, by 2010 this original car park had become a designated area for staff parking only. A new car park, located on the east side of the ring road, provided parking for members of the public.</p>

<p><em><strong>Both of the sentences above are wrong!</strong></em> You don't "give" a test or exam. This is the wrong <strong>verb + noun</strong> collocation.</p>
<p>Here are some <em><strong>correct collocations</strong></em> with the words test or exam:</p>

<p>When telling stories, native speakers use lots of 'natural' linking words and phrases. Have a look at the following examples from my description:</p>
<ul>
<li>This happened (referring to previous sentence)</li>
<li>and at some point</li>
<li>so</li>
<li>It (referring to the restaurant previously mentioned)</li>

<p>Notice that <em><strong>I didn't use any of the typical linking words that people learn</strong></em> (Moreover, Furthermore etc.). Those lists of typical linking phrases won't help you to get a higher score. Try to practise 'natural' linking instead!</p>

				<p>Look at the two short paragraphs below. Can you see the difference between them?</p>
<p><strong>Paragraph 1</strong><br>Every member of society should contribute to improving the environment. We all need to take responsibility for the environmental issues that face the planet. If each individual person plays his or her part, our world will remain habitable for future generations.</p>
<p><strong>Paragraph 2</strong><br>Every member of society should contribute to improving the environment. Small daily actions, like turning lights off or recycling paper, glass and plastics, can make a difference. I also try to play my part by walking or by taking public transport rather than driving.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis</strong></p>
<p>Paragraph 1 might look good in terms of the vocabulary that I used, but it doesn't really move forward. The three sentences basically say the same thing in different ways. It's all too general.</p>
<p>Paragraph 2 might seem simpler, but it's much better in terms of 'task response' and 'coherence' because the main idea is extended and we can see some progression. Can you see the <em><strong>movement from general to specific</strong></em> in this paragraph?</p>

				<p>I've been checking students' essays this week, and one of the most noticeable problems has been this: <em><strong>most essays are too general</strong></em>, and so there's not enough development and progression of ideas.</p>
<p>When writing a paragraph, or when giving a longer answer in part 3 of the speaking test, try to use a <em><strong>general to specific</strong></em> approach. Start with a general idea, then explain it in more detail.</p>
<p>Note: Don't just explain the same general idea in a different way. Your answer needs to <em><strong>move forward</strong></em>.</p>

	<p>
				<p>One of the main aims of this blog is to give people a method for tackling each aspect of the IELTS test.</p>
<p>I hear from many people who have been successful after following my advice, but I also hear from people who haven't passed yet. And when people are stuck on the same score, they sometimes think that "the method isn't working". But this is the wrong way to think.</p>
<p>Methods / exam techniques will only help you to get the score that reflects your current level of English. If your English level is 'beginner' or 'intermediate', no method will suddenly give you a band 7. Exam techniques don't increase your vocabulary knowledge or your grammatical accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>Remember that we're working on 2 things here:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Methods e.g. knowing how to write an essay.</li>
<li>English language e.g. expressing your ideas using good vocabulary and without making mistakes.</li>

<p>But what is 'topic specific' vocabulary?</p>
<p>The answer is: vocabulary that you would <em><strong>probably only use for one particular essay topic</strong></em>. For example, I used this vocabulary in a lesson last week:</p>
<p>- no visual element<br>- brings us closer to reality<br>- presented in limited depth<br>- excellent communication tools<br>- an even greater impact on the viewer</p>
<p>You might be able to adapt these phrases to a different topic, but it wouldn't be easy; they are quite specific to the particular question in <a href="https://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2019/04/ielts-writing-task-2-a-rare-5-paragraph-essay.html">this lesson</a>. However, these are the kind of words and phrases that you need if you want to get a good vocabulary score.</p>

	<p>
				<p>I've written about this several times before, but people still ask me for lists of phrases for any essay. For example, I received this question the other day:</p>
<p><em>"Please send me some common phrases that I will write in many essays."</em></p>
<p>If you've followed my lessons on this blog, you'll know that "any essay" phrases are not the secret to getting a high score in IELTS writing. In fact, I recommend that you work on the opposite: vocabulary for specific topics like education, family, work or the environment. You can use linking words/phrases in any essay, but these only help your <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2013/10/ielts-advice-how-essays-are-marked.html">coherence and cohesion</a>, not your vocabulary score. So please forget the idea of "phrases for any essay", and focus instead on vocabulary for <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2016/05/ielts-vocabulary-topic-list.html">topics</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Here's my band 9 sample answer:</strong></p>
<p>The tables compare the percentages of British university students who spoke different languages in addition to English in two separate years.</p>
<p>It is noticeable that in both years, 2000 and 2010, the majority of British students at the university in question were able to speak at least one other language. We can also see an increase in the proportion of second and third language speakers over the 10-year period.</p>
<p>In the year 2000, 80% of the students were able to speak one or two foreign languages, and 20% only spoke English. Ten years later, there was a rise of 5% in the proportion of those who spoke a second language. There was also an increase, from 10% to 15%, in the proportion of students who were able to speak two foreign languages.</p>
<p>Looking at the specific second languages spoken, in 2000, 30% of the students were able to speak Spanish, 15% spoke French, and 10% spoke German. By 2010, the proportion of Spanish speakers had risen to 35%, there were 5% fewer French speakers, and the figure for German speakers remained at one in ten. Finally, we can see that the percentage of speakers of other second languages, apart from Spanish, French and German, rose from 15% to 20% over the period shown.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Many IELTS students become obsessed with 'linkers' - words or phrases that link ideas together in a paragraph e.g. firstly, secondly, furthermore, moreover. There is nothing wrong with using linkers, and they can certainly help you to write good paragraphs.</p>
<p>However, linkers become a problem when they are the only thing that students care about. Examiners care much more about the <em><strong>content between</strong></em> the linkers.</p>
<p>As an experiment, try writing a paragraph without linking words. Can you still make your paragraph coherent? Note: you probably don't use many linkers when you write in your own language!</p>

	<p>
				<p>Many students believe that they need to use <em><strong>difficult grammar</strong></em> in order to get a band 7 or higher. But, in fact, the secret to a high grammar score is being able to write <em><strong>error-free</strong></em> sentences.</p>
<p>Look at the band descriptors for writing task 2 and you'll see this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Band 7: frequent error-free sentences</li>
<li>Band 8: the majority of sentences are error-free</li>
</ul>
<p>So, there's no point trying to impress the examiner with difficult structures if none of your sentences are error-free. It's better to keep things simple and avoid mistakes.</p>

	<p>
				<p>As I've said before, there is no 'secret' way to improve your IELTS score. You just need to study hard and keep practising. However, if I had to give one piece of advice, it would be this: work on <em><strong>vocabulary</strong></em>.</p>
<p>If you use a wide range of vocabulary in the speaking and writing exams, you are more likely to get a high score. Vocabulary is also the key to finding the answers in the reading test and understanding the speakers in the listening test.</p>
<p>So, are you writing new words and phrases in a notebook every day? Do you read something in English every day? Do you use a dictionary? Do you use Google or Wikipedia to look up words and phrases? If you don't do these things, start now!</p>

	<p>
				<p>Regarding the advice that I gave yesterday (stop and smile), I just want to clarify that there are no marks for body language in the speaking test. The "stop and smile" idea is simply a way to show the examiner that you're ready for the next question in part 1 of the test.</p>
<p>So, smiling won't help your score, but it can help with the "flow" of questions and answers in part 1.</p>

	<p>
				<p>What are the best things to do in the last week before your exam? Here are some tips:</p>
<p><strong>1. Nothing new</strong><br>It's often best not to study anything new just before an exam. "Revision" means studying what you have already studied to make sure that you know it well. The aim is to be confident about what you <em><strong>do</strong></em> know, rather than worrying about what you <em><strong>don't</strong></em> know.</p>
<p><strong>2. Common topics</strong><br>It's always a good idea to look again at the most common topics for IELTS writing and speaking. Make sure you have some ideas, opinions and vocabulary for topics like 'education', 'environment' etc.</p>
<p><strong>3. Test practice</strong><br>If you have never done a full test (e.g. a full one-hour reading test) before, you might get a shock in the real exam! Timing is a big problem, so practise a full test in strict exam conditions. Don't worry about your score; just focus on finishing everything within the time limit.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Many people work hard but with the wrong aims. Their hard work takes them in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>Here are two examples of the <strong>wrong aims</strong> (for IELTS students):</p>
<ol>
<li>Learning "impressive" phrases for linking and organising your ideas.</li>
<li>Becoming better at English grammar by working through exercises in a grammar book.</li>
</ol>
<p>You could do many hours of hard work on these two aims, but I doubt that your IELTS scores would improve.</p>
<p>Your next question should be: What are the <strong>right aims</strong>? If you've read enough of my lessons, you'll know what I think. Maybe you would like to share your aims in the comments below this lesson, and we can discuss and refine them.</p>

	<p>
				<p>If you can use "less common" vocabulary correctly, that's great. However, using "difficult" words or grammar often leads to lots of mistakes. It would be better to choose "easy but accurate" language instead.</p>
<p>For example, here are some students' sentences, with <span style="text-decoration: underline;">mistakes underlined</span>:</p>
<p>1) The highest number of people <span style="text-decoration: underline;">residence</span> in Australia are those living in cities.<br>2) The highest <span style="text-decoration: underline;">population of birth</span> are those born within Australia.<br>3) This figure was over 50% <span style="text-decoration: underline;">of</span> those <span style="text-decoration: underline;">given birth to</span> outside Australia.</p>
<p>Let's rewrite these sentences in an "easy but accurate" way:</p>
<p>1) The majority of Australians <span style="text-decoration: underline;">live</span> in cities.<br>2) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Most</span> of the people who live in Australia <span style="text-decoration: underline;">were born</span> there.<br>3) This was over 50% <span style="text-decoration: underline;">higher than</span> the figure for people <span style="text-decoration: underline;">born</span> outside Australia.</p>

	<p>
				<p>People who become good at things do the basics well, and they only show off occasionally.</p>
<p>For example, native speakers (of any language) spend most of their time using clear and relatively simple language. They might add a 'flourish' here and there, but it's rare to meet a native speaker who tries to make every sentence seem impressive.</p>
<p>I try to persuade students to aim for this 'natural' native-speaker style of writing and speaking. Learn to write and speak in a clear, simple, accurate and coherent way. Leave the rhetorical flourishes to politicians and professional writers!</p>

				<p>Every IELTS teacher will suggest a slightly different way of doing each part of the test. In other words, teachers have different methods.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there are principles that all IELTS teachers should agree on. For example, when you write an essay, you need to present a clear position and answer all parts of the question.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Let's analyse some of the sentences in the <a href="https://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2019/03/ielts-writing-task-1-physical-activity-answer.html">bar chart answer</a> that I wrote last week. Maybe you could analyse the other sentences in the same way.</p>
<p><strong>Sentence 1</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this sentence is to begin the description by stating what the bar chart shows. The main feature of the sentence is the paraphrasing (of the question statement) that it contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>The bar chart = the chart</li>
<li>shows = compares</li>
<li>the percentage of = the proportions of</li>
<li>men and women = males and females</li>
<li>in different age groups = in six age categories</li>
<li>did regular physical activity = were physically active on a regular basis</li>
<li>in 2010 = in the year 2010</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sentence 2</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this sentence is to give a general overview of the information, by describing an overall trend. Some useful language:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>roughly speaking</em> - a nice way to introduce an approximate overall trend</li>
<li><em>close to half of Australian adults</em> - grouping men and women in all age categories together, in order to describe an overall trend</li>
<li><em>some kind of routine physical activity</em> - paraphrasing ‘regular physical activity’</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sentence 3</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this sentence is to continue the overview by highlighting the highest and lowest figures on the chart. Some useful language:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Middle aged females</em> - more than one age category grouped together</li>
<li><em>the most physically active</em> - highlighting age categories with the highest figures</li>
<li><em>proportionally</em> - this word is necessary because the figures show percentages of people in each age group, not raw numbers</li>
<li><em>while males</em> - contrasting with the statement about females</li>
<li><em>the least physical activity</em> - contrasting the highest with the lowest</li>
</ul>

	<p>
				<p>Let's return to the task below and look at my sample answer.</p>
<p><em><strong>The bar chart below shows the percentage of Australian men and women in different age groups who did regular physical activity in 2010.</strong></em></p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c0240a46ef03d200d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Activity" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c0240a46ef03d200d img-responsive" src="https://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c0240a46ef03d200d-500wi" title="Activity"></a></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Cambridge IELTS 12)</span></em></p>
<p>The chart compares the proportions of Australian males and females in six age categories who were physically active on a regular basis in the year 2010.</p>
<p>Roughly speaking, close to half of Australian adults did some kind of routine physical activity in 2010. Middle aged females were the most physically active, proportionally, while males aged 35 to 44 did the least physical activity.</p>
<p>In the youngest age category (15 to 24), almost 53% of Australian men but only 47.7% of women did regular physical activity in 2010. However, between the ages of 25 and 44, men were much less active on average than women. In fact, in the 35 to 44 age group, a mere 39.5% of males did some form of regular exercise, compared to 52.5% of females.</p>
<p>Between the ages of 45 and 64, the figure for male physical activity rose to around 45%, while the proportion of active females remained around 8% higher, at 53%. Finally, the percentages of Australian women and men aged 65 and over who exercised regularly were almost identical, at approximately 47%.</p>

	<p>
				<p>A few people have asked me about these phrases. Do they have the same meaning? When is each one used?</p>
<p><strong>By contrast / In contrast</strong><br>I often use these two phrases in both writing task 1 and 2. They are exactly the same, and are used in a similar way to "however" or "on the other hand" to introduce a contrast / comparison. Put "By / In contrast" at the beginning of a sentence, with a comma after "contrast".</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong><br>Unemployment rose in the UK. By contrast, the number of unemployed people in Canada fell.</p>
<p><strong>On the contrary</strong><br>I don't think you'll need this phrase for any part of the IELTS test.&nbsp;It doesn't mean the same thing as "by / in contrast". We use "on the contrary" to deny that something is true, and to explain that the opposite is true.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong><br>- Person 1: "You had some problems with your hotel, didn't you?"<br>- Person 2: "On the contrary, the hotel was great, but the airline lost my suitcase."</p>

				<p><strong>Two</strong> of the sentences below contain a small mistake. Can you find the two mistakes?</p>

<li>In 2008, British parents spent an average of around £20 per month on their children’s sporting activities.</li>
<li>Parents’ spending on children’s sports was increased gradually over the following six years, and by 2014 the average monthly amount had risen to just over £30.</li>
<li>The number of British children who played football remained relatively stable over the six-year period, at around 8 to 9 million.</li>
<li>Swimming rose from approximately 2 million children in 2008 to around 4 million in 2014.</li>
<li>There was a slight fall in participation in athletics between 2012 and 2014.</li>

	<p>
				<p>The list of <em><strong>less common vocabulary</strong></em> in yesterday's lesson didn't contain any words that are 'big' or impressive on their own.</p>
<p>In fact, if you're trying to impress the examiner with good vocabulary, you shouldn't be worrying about <em><strong>individual</strong></em> words at all. Instead, you should be trying to show that you can use <em><strong>interesting groups of words</strong></em>.</p>
<p>Here's an easy example. The three words below are not particularly special or impressive on their own:</p>
<p>- incredible<br>- beautiful<br>- images</p>
<p>But look at how I put these words together in the sentence below:</p>
<p><em><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; -moz-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">The TV trailers were really eye-catching because they showed <strong>incredibly beautiful images</strong> of nature.</span></em></p>
<p>The phrase "incredibly beautiful images" is much more interesting (and 'less common') than the three individual words that it contains.</p>
<p><strong>Remember:</strong> It's only when you start putting words together that the language comes alive. Focus on groups of words, not individual 'big' words.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Did you note down the following 'less common' phrases from the description that I wrote yesterday? Could you use these phrases in your own sentences?</p>
<ul>
<li>each episode featured</li>
<li>spectacular footage</li>
<li>it was broadcast</li>
<li>the DVD box set</li>
<li>it was advertised repeatedly</li>
<li>it was aired (means 'it was shown on TV')</li>
<li>the trailers were eye-catching</li>
<li>incredibly beautiful images</li>
<li>the voice of the narrator</li>
<li>stunning photography</li>
<li>global scope</li>
<li>to film such interesting creatures in so many locations</li>
<li>opened my eyes to the hidden wonders of our planet</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em><br>The phrase 'less common vocabulary' (or 'uncommon lexical items') is used in the examiner's mark scheme. It refers to any vocabulary that examiners don't expect most candidates to use. But this <em><strong>doesn't</strong></em> mean 'difficult' words; it means the kind of 'natural' phrases that native speakers use. A good example is "DVD box set" - this isn't a difficult phrase, but it's something that English <span style="text-decoration: underline;">learners</span> might not be expected to use.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here's a useful question that someone asked me:</p>
<p><em>Is it a good idea to use statistical terms such as <strong>linear / exponential growth</strong> instead of more general phrases like <strong>gradual / significant increase</strong>?</em></p>
<p>My answer is no. I don't advise you to write about linear or exponential growth in writing task 1. You are not expected to have any technical knowledge of statistics in this task, and so this kind of "statistics language" seems a little forced and inappropriate to me.</p>
<p>Just use the 'normal' phrases that I use in my example answers here on the blog. Don't try to write like a professional statistician, and don't use the exaggerated language that I mentioned in <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2014/08/ielts-vocabulary-soar-rocket-plummet.html">this lesson</a>.</p>

	<p>
				<p>IELTS isn't simply a test of how much 'difficult' vocabulary and grammar you can use. It also tests your ability to do 'easy' things with the language, like making a simple sentence that contains no mistakes.</p>
<p>Speaking part 1 is a good example of this. In this part of the speaking test, you will impress the examiner by answering without hesitation, by speaking in a natural and fluid way, and by using error-free simple sentences. You can show off your best language later in the test, but you should start, in part 1, by showing the examiner that you can do the 'easy' things well.</p>
<p>Note: many people don't do the easy things well.</p>

	<p>
				<p>A colleague asked me for some advice about how to help a student who is so worried about the IELTS writing test that she feels unable to write an essay. She says she has a mental block and just can't start writing.</p>
<p>In my opinion, this student's problem is that she is aiming too high too soon. She wants to write the perfect essay now, but she is afraid that she won't. She's putting too much pressure on herself to be successful.</p>
<p>So here's some advice for people who feel stuck or afraid: aim much lower! Imagine you're a lazy student who just wants to do his/her homework as quickly as possible, and write an essay that you know isn't your best work - write it quickly and carelessly. Write another 'bad' essay the next day and the day after that. Soon the fear of essay writing will have disappeared, and you'll start wanting to improve your 'bad' essays. When the fear of failure has gone, you'll be free to enjoy the challenge and to do your best work.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> if you are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> suffering from this essay writing 'fear', please ignore the advice above. Aim high, enjoy the challenge, and do your best work now!</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here are some study ideas for task 1:</p>
<p><strong>1) Print a collection of questions</strong><br>Before you start writing any task 1 reports, it's a good idea to have an overview of the different types of questions that you might face. Try to get paper copies (printed) of around 10 different questions - it's useful to be able to see them all in one place. Your 'pack' of questions should include: a line graph, bar chart, pie chart, table, 2 different charts, 3 or more similar charts, process diagram, comparison diagram, life cycle, map.</p>
<p><strong>2) Practise parts of reports</strong><br>Instead of writing a full report, try writing 10&nbsp;<a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2012/11/ielts-writing-task-1-introduction-technique.html" target="_self">introductions</a> - one for each of the questions in your 'pack' (see point 1 above). The next time you are studying, just focus on writing <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2011/04/ielts-writing-task-1-the-overview.html" target="_self">overviews</a>. On a different day, practise describing percentages, or comparing numbers etc...</p>
<p><strong>3) Use model answers</strong><br>If you look through my task 1 lessons on this site, you'll find examples of the 10 question types mentioned in point 1. Use my answers as models, and try to copy my way of writing as closely as you can.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here are some techniques that should help you to paraphrase (to say the same thing in different ways):</p>
<p><strong>1) Use a synonym</strong></p>
<p>This is important = This is significant / crucial / vital</p>
<p><strong>2) Use an opposite</strong></p>
<p>I found it difficult = It wasn't easy for me</p>
<p><strong>3) Change active to passive</strong></p>
<p>You should not do this = This should not be done</p>
<p><strong>4) Use a related word (e.g. change the verb into a noun)</strong></p>
<p>The number rose = There was a rise in the number</p>
<p><strong>5) Consider a more formal or informal version</strong></p>
<p>I am worried = I am extremely concerned (formal) / I'm stressed out (informal)</p>
<p><strong>Task:</strong><br>Try using some of these techniques, and let me know if you think of any others.</p>

	<p>
				<p>In the speaking test, some candidates try to involve the examiner in the conversation. For example:</p>
<p><em>Examiner:</em> Do you like cooking?<br><em>Student:</em> Not really, I prefer eating in restaurants. And you?</p>
<p>You should definitely <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> do this!</p>

<p><em><strong>If you can already write at the same level as me, you don't need my help!</strong></em></p>
<p>The best way to learn is to have a teacher who takes you just outside your comfort zone. If the work is too easy you won't progress, and if it's far too difficult you won't be able to do it. A good teacher should give you work that is difficult, but achievable with help. Hopefully the paragraph that I wrote on Wednesday fits that description.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Several people have asked me for help with the following task from Cambridge IELTS book 12 (test 5).</p>
<p><em><strong>The bar chart below shows the percentage of Australian men and women in different age groups who did regular physical activity in 2010.</strong></em></p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c022ad3d0ec01200b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Cambridge 12 bar chart" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c022ad3d0ec01200b img-responsive" src="https://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c022ad3d0ec01200b-500wi" title="Cambridge 12 bar chart"></a></p>
<p>Before we describe the chart, let's get one important thing right: <strong>'the big picture'</strong>. In other words, I want you to think about the information that you would put in your overview / summary paragraph.</p>
<p>Try to answer the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What was the overall percentage (i.e. average or range) of <em><strong>all Australian men and women</strong></em> who did regular physical activity in 2010?</li>
<li>Are there any differences between the figures for men and women, looking at <em><strong>all age groups</strong></em>?</li>
<li>Were any age groups noticeably more (or less) active than the others?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Remember:</strong> Most IELTS candidates fail to write a good overview of the information in writing task 1. We need to practise looking at the 'big picture'.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here's my quick brainstorm on the theme of the word 'easy'. I've divided it into a few different categories; you might find it helpful to do this yourself when brainstorming ideas.</p>
<p>Synonyms of 'easy'</p>
<ul>
<li>simple, straightforward, uncomplicated, effortless</li>

<ul>
<li>a piece of cake, a walk in the park, a breeze, a doddle</li>

<ul>
<li>it wasn't difficult, it wasn't hard, it didn't take much effort, it wasn't very challenging, it didn't present any real problems, I didn't really struggle</li>
</ul>
<p>Use an example to create context e.g. 'the exam was easy'</p>
<ul>
<li>it was fairly simple, I found it quite straightforward, I breezed through it, I could have done it in my sleep, it was easier than I expected</li>

				<p>In yesterday’s lesson I brainstormed the theme of a modern apartment. It’s easy to brainstorm ideas when you focus on a specific word, and I was able to produce a useful list of ideas related to the word ‘modern’.</p>
<p>You can use this technique as a way to prepare for topics and to expand your overall vocabulary knowledge. Just choose a word (your ‘theme’) and brainstorm ideas related to it. You could also use the Internet as a source of ideas.&nbsp;</p>

	<p>
				<p>When I'm writing a task 1 report, either for this blog or with my students, I never worry about 'grammatical range'. Here's why:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, how many different 'grammatical structures' can we really use in the space of only 8 or 9 sentences?</li>
<li>Second, do we have time to think about including an example of a passive, a conditional, various types of clause etc.?</li>
<li>Third, will these different structures be relevant? Will they work in the context of the description?</li>
</ul>
<p>I think it's much more important to spend the 20 minutes thinking about how best to describe the information on the chart in a clear and logical way. In other words, I suggest that you focus on task response, coherence and accuracy. This is what examiners are really looking for in task 1.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Yesterday I suggested that you'll need to work on both exam technique and English language as you prepare for the IELTS test. So how can IELTS-Simon help you with these two things?</p>
<p><strong>Exam technique</strong><br>The fastest way to learn how to approach the IELTS test is to watch the video lessons that I published on <a href="http://subscriptions.viddler.com/SimonCorcoran">this website</a>. The videos take you step by step through each part of the test, and you'll see me giving band 9 answers using clear and simple exam techniques. I consider the video lessons to be my best work, and I don't know of any other course that provides such a methodical and effective approach.</p>
<p>Of course, this blog contains the same advice that you'll find in the video lessons. The difference is that the blog isn't written as a step-by-step course. If you have the time, go back through the blog's <a href="https://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/archives.html">archives</a> or <a href="https://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2016/07/ielts-advice-search-this-website.html">search</a> the blog for anything that you need. I think I've probably written a lesson about almost any IELTS problem that you might have.</p>
<p><strong>English language</strong><br>The ultimate aim of this blog is to help you to improve your English. You'll find many lessons in which language, rather than exam technique, is the main focus.</p>
<p>I'm also trying to cover as many IELTS topics as possible here on the blog, and you'll find plenty of vocabulary ideas (words, phrases, examples, opinions etc.) that you can 'copy' from me and use in your own answers.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong><br>Describe an interesting house or apartment.</p>
<p><strong>First three sentences of the answer:</strong><br><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important;">Well, living in an apartment is an overgrowing trend not only in my country but all over the world. We have our own apartment which is really awesome. By the way, I would like to talk about a new apartment/flat that I have recently visited.</span></p>
<p>The real answer begins in the third sentence with the words <em><strong>"I would like to talk about"</strong></em>. This is where I would begin. Everything before that is just background waffle*. Examiners don't like this waffle; you'll impress them more if you get straight to the point and answer directly.</p>
<p>waffle = lengthy but vague or trivial talk or writing (i.e. useless extra words that you don't need)</p>

	<p>
				<p>Several people have asked me to explain how the past perfect tense can be used in writing task 1. The example below might help.</p>
<p><em><strong>Look at the following description:</strong></em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In</span> 2002, the cost of an average house in the UK <span style="text-decoration: underline;">was</span> £130,000. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">By</span> 2007, the average house price <span style="text-decoration: underline;">had risen</span> to almost £190,000.</p>
<p><em><strong>Notice the verbs used with "in" and "by":</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>I used "in" with the past simple "was" to talk about what happened in one year only (2002).</li>
<li>I used "by" with the past perfect "had risen" to talk about an increase that happened in the years <strong><em>before</em></strong> 2007 (from 2002 to 2007).</li>
</ul>
<p>Try writing your own sentences with "in" and "by" to practise describing numbers with the past simple and past perfect.</p>

<p>Remember: exam tips and techniques are useful and important, but <em><strong>the surest way to improve your IELTS score is by improving your English</strong></em>.</p>

<p><strong>1) A simple description of one number:</strong></p>
<p>In 2006, 17% of mobile phone owners played games on their phones.</p>
<p><strong>2) Comparing three numbers in the same sentence:</strong></p>
<p>In 2010, 73% of mobile phone owners used their phones to search the Internet, while 41% of users played games and only 26% of people played music on their phones.</p>
<p><strong>3) Describing a change in numbers:</strong></p>
<p>Between 2008 and 2010, the proportion of mobile phone owners who recorded videos on their phones rose by 26%, from 9% to 35%.</p>
<p><em><strong>Tip:</strong><br></em>These three types of sentence are so important. If you want to do well in IELTS writing task 1, you should practise them a lot!<em><br></em></p>

	<p>
				<p>A student asked me about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_they">this page</a> on Wikipedia, which gives three examples of the words "they" and "their" being used to refer to singular nouns:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Somebody</span> left <em><strong>their</strong></em> umbrella here. Would <em><strong>they</strong></em> please collect it?</li>
<li>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">patient</span> should be told how much <em><strong>they</strong></em> will be required to pay.</li>
<li>A <span style="text-decoration: underline;">journalist</span> should not be forced to reveal <em><strong>their</strong></em> sources.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>They</strong></em> and <em><strong>their</strong></em> are used instead of <strong><em>he or she</em></strong> and <em><strong>his or her</strong></em>.</p>
<p>This is very common in English, and it is unlikely that someone would say: "Somebody left <em><strong>his or her</strong></em> umbrella. Would <em><strong>he or she</strong></em> please collect it?"</p>
<p>But can we use "they" with a singular in the IELTS test?</p>
<p>The simple answer is yes, but my own preference is a little more complicated. When speaking, I naturally use "they" with singular nouns from time to time. But I tend to avoid doing this in written essays, as I prefer to stick to the normal grammatical conventions. For example, I used "he or she" in the sentence below, which comes from <a href="Firstly, it is hard for a person to be happy if he or she does not have a safe place to live and enough food to eat.">this essay</a>.</p>
<p><em><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; -moz-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">Firstly, it is hard for a person to be happy if <strong>he or she</strong> does not have a safe place to live and enough food to eat.</span></em></p>

<p>Native speakers use "and" all the time (in both speech and writing). You can use "and" or "but" as many times as you want; the examiner will not notice!</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you use "moreover" or "furthermore" more than once, the examiner will notice straight away. These words do not get you a high score. In fact, in the speaking exam, they make your English sound 'forced'.</p>

</ul>
<p>Here you have three simple sentences with the same basic word order, the same subject-verb relationship, and with the year and percentage in the same position. As a result, the description seems a bit like a <em><strong>list</strong></em>.</p>
<p>The <em><strong>list sentences</strong></em> that I showed you in last week's <a href="https://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2018/11/ielts-writing-task-1-list-sentences.html">lesson</a> do not create the same problem.

When you are speaking or writing (in any context, not just for the IELTS test), the way you structure your ideas makes a difference. A good structure keeps your audience (the listener or reader) interested and on track; it will also add to the coherence, power and persuasiveness of your message.</p>
<p>Consider this example: a sales presentation using a "problem and solution" structure. The sales person explains a problem and then tells the audience how his/her product or service can solve this problem. This simple structure is used in countless advertising and marketing campaigns.</p>
<p>Now let's think about the structures that we use in the IELTS test. Can you list the structures that I've used in my speaking and writing lessons? Here's one example: "answer, explain, example" in part 3 of the speaking test.</p>

<p><em><strong>The diagrams below show the stages and equipment used in the cement-making process, and how cement is used to produce concrete for building purposes.</strong></em></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(This task comes from Cambridge IELTS book 8)</span></p>
<p>The first diagram illustrates the process of cement manufacture, and the second diagram shows the materials that go into the production of concrete.</p>
<p>It is clear that there are five stages in the production of cement, beginning with the input of raw materials and ending with bags of the finished product. To produce concrete, four different materials are mixed together.</p>
<p>At the first stage in the production of cement, limestone and clay are crushed to form a powder. This powder is then mixed before it passes into a rotating heater. After heating, the resulting mixture is ground, and cement is produced. Finally, the cement is packaged in large bags.</p>
<p>Cement is one of the four raw materials that are used in the production of concrete, along with gravel, sand and water. To be exact, concrete consists of 50% gravel, 25% sand, 15% cement and 10% water. All four materials are blended together in a rotating machine called a concrete mixer.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Looking at the 'cement process' diagram below, let's think about the verbs that we'll need to use. There are various options.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c022ad399ad21200d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Cement" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c022ad399ad21200d img-responsive" src="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c022ad399ad21200d-250wi" style="width: 230px;" title="Cement"></a></p>
<p>Let's start with the 5 nouns that mark the 5 stages of this process:<br>crusher, mixer, heater, grinder, bags</p>
<p>We can convert these nouns into <strong>passive</strong> verb forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Limestone and clay <strong>are crushed</strong>.</li>
<li>The resulting powder <strong>is mixed</strong>.</li>
<li>It <strong>is heated</strong>.</li>
<li>Then it <strong>is ground</strong>.</li>
<li>The final product, cement, <strong>is bagged</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Or we can keep the original nouns, and use <strong>active or passive</strong> verbs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Limestone and clay <strong>are placed</strong> in a crusher. (passive)</li>
<li>The resulting powder <strong>goes</strong> into a mixer. (active)</li>
<li>It then <strong>passes</strong> through a rotating heater. (active)</li>
<li>The heated mixture <strong>is put</strong> into a grinder. (passive)</li>
<li>The cement <strong>is packaged</strong> in large bags. (passive)</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, the best approach is to use a mix of the above options:</p>
<p>At the first stage in the production of cement, limestone and clay <strong>are crushed</strong> to form a powder. This powder <strong>is</strong> then <strong>mixed</strong> before it <strong>passes</strong> into a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">rotating heater</span>. After heating, the resulting mixture <strong>is ground</strong>, and cement <strong>is produced</strong>, Finally, the cement <strong>is put</strong> in large <span style="text-decoration: underline;">bags</span>.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Yesterday I advised you to <em><strong>start slowly</strong></em> when studying something new. Today I'd like to share a short conversation that I had with a student. I think this is a good example of a problem that many students face: they don't take the time to do things slowly and properly!</p>
<p><strong>The student's question:</strong><br>Hi Simon. Brainstorming ideas when I'm writing essays didn't work for me. My essays look better when I'm writing without planning and brainstorming. Should I continue brainstorming until I'm good at it or write without planning. What do you advise?</p>
<p><strong>My answer:</strong><br>My advice is this: whenever you try a new technique, start very slowly. So, try following my planning advice again, but give yourself as much time as you need. It doesn't matter if it takes you an hour to create a good essay plan at first - just aim to get the plan right. Then see what happens when you write an essay using a really good plan. Again, don't give yourself a time limit. When you're comfortable planning and writing in this way, gradually speed up! Perhaps your problem was that you were going too fast.</p>
<p><strong>The student's response:</strong><br>Definitely, yes you are right I'm going too fast and I always place importance on the speed of my writing. The reason I am in a hurry is I think there are lots of topics I need to work on.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Imagine a musician (pianist, guitarist etc.) who is learning a new technique, or a new piece of music or song. Musicians learn by going slowly at first and gradually speeding up as they become familiar with the technique or music.</p>
<p>I recommend the same when you start preparing for IELTS, or when you learn a new exam technique or study a new topic: start slowly. Try to achieve the score you need at <strong><em>slow speed</em></strong>, and then gradually reduce the time until you can do the same at <strong><em>exam speed</em></strong>.</p>

	<p>
				<p>To write an introduction about a <em><strong>process diagram</strong></em>, just paraphrase the question statement as usual.</p>
<p>For the overview, here are some general things that you could mention:</p>
<p>- the number of stages in the process<br>- where / how the process begins and ends<br>- the items (e.g. materials) involved in the process</p>
<p>Let's return to the 'cement' task and write the introduction and overview.</p>
<p><em><strong>The diagrams below show the stages and equipment used in the cement-making process, and how cement is used to produce concrete for building purposes.</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>Introduction and overview:</strong></em></p>
<p>The first diagram illustrates the process of cement manufacture, and the second diagram shows the materials that go into the production of concrete.</p>
<p>It is clear that there are five stages in the production of cement, beginning with the input of raw materials and ending with bags of the finished product. To produce concrete, four different materials are mixed together.</p>

	<p>
				<p>I've written about this before, but I think it's a message that I need to keep repeating:</p>
<p>Too many candidates approach the IELTS exam with a <em><strong>grammar mindset</strong></em>. They go into the test with their heads full of 'grammatical structures' that they think will impress the examiner. Unfortunately this approach is more likely to hinder you than help you.</p>
<p>I'm trying to persuade people to have a <em><strong>vocabulary mindset</strong></em>. This means that you go into the test knowing that you have prepared ideas for common IELTS topics, and with the aim of expressing your ideas coherently and in as much detail as you can.</p>
<p>Here's a quick question to see which mindset you have:</p>
<p><em><strong>Which of the two activities below do you spend more time doing?</strong></em></p>
<ol>
<li>practising complex sentences, passives and conditionals; learning lists of linking words and phrases; worrying that you make too many mistakes</li>
<li>collecting ideas for IELTS topics and past exam questions; reading and listening to English (not just IELTS related); trying to copy the way native speakers write and speak</li>

	<p>
				<p>Someone asked me for help with the diagram task below. I wrote one paragraph about this diagram in <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2012/12/ielts-writing-task-1-process-diagrams.html">this lesson</a> back in 2012, but I didn't finish the full answer. So let's take another look:</p>
<p><em><strong>The diagrams below show the stages and equipment used in the cement-making process, and how cement is used to produce concrete for building purposes.</strong></em></p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c022ad3704894200c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Cement" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c022ad3704894200c img-responsive" src="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c022ad3704894200c-500wi" title="Cement"></a></p>
<p>Of course, we're going to describe the steps in the cement-making process and the method for making concrete.</p>
<p>But before doing that, we need an <strong>introduction</strong> and <strong>overview</strong>. How would you write these two paragraphs?</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here are a few things to remember with regard to the 'super cohesion' technique that we looked at in last week's <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2018/09/ielts-writing-task-1-super-cohesion.html">lesson</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>I chose the name 'super cohesion' for two reasons: first, because I think it's a great way to structure a task 1 answer; and second, because it's a name that I hope people will remember (nobody remembers the word 'good', but maybe you'll remember 'super').</li>
<li>You'll need to practise this way of writing several / many times before you become confident enough to use it in a real exam.</li>
<li>I don't always use the 'super cohesion' structure myself. It's a nice option, but it's <em><strong>not</strong></em> something that you <em><strong>must</strong></em> do.</li>

	<p>
				<p>There is usually a <strong>gap</strong> between the IELTS scores that people get when they practise at home and the scores they get when they take a real test.</p>
<p>For example, maybe you can achieve a band 7 when you write essays without a time limit, but you get a band 6 when you take the test. This is a gap of one band.</p>
<p>Here are some tips relating to this 'performance gap':</p>
<ol>
<li>There should be a gap!</li>
<li>If there isn't a gap, something is wrong with the way you're studying.</li>
<li>If the gap is too big, you're doing something wrong in the exam.</li>
<li>First, try to make the gap bigger through study and learning.</li>
<li>Then try to make the gap smaller by practising in exam conditions.</li>
</ol>
<p>I hope this makes sense! Let me know if you've noticed this gap. How big is it, and what are you doing to make it bigger or smaller?</p>

	<p>
				<p>If you go back to <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2018/07/ielts-writing-task-1-develop-the-overview.html">this lesson</a>, you'll see some advice about "developing the overview". The idea was that you write two sentences in your overview paragraph, and then you write each 'details' paragraph (3 and 4) by developing one of these overview sentences.</p>
<p>I'm calling this 'super cohesion' because it creates a very logical and connected structure. There is cohesion <strong>across</strong> the paragraphs, as well as <strong>within</strong> them.</p>
<p>I tried the same technique when I wrote last week's task 1 answer. Here it is again, with the 'super cohesion' highlighted:</p>
<p>..........</p>
<p><em>The bar chart illustrates the frequency with which Americans ate in fast food establishments from 2003 to 2013.</em></p>
<p><em><span style="background-color: #c0ff80;">It is clear that the majority of Americans ate in fast food restaurants between once a week and once a month in all three years.</span> <span style="background-color: #bfdfff;">We can also see a shift towards eating in these restaurants less frequently by the end of the 10-year period.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="background-color: #c0ff80;">In each of the years shown on the chart, close to 60% of people in the US ate in fast food restaurants between once and four times a month. Roughly 15 to 20% of Americans reported eating in fast food outlets several times per week, while 3 to 4% of people ate in these outlets daily. At the other end of the scale, around 4% of people avoided fast food restaurants completely.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="background-color: #bfdfff;">Between 2006 and 2013, the total proportion of Americans who ate in fast food establishments either once a week or several times a week fell by almost 10%. At the same time, there was an increase of around 8% in the ‘once or twice a month’ category. In other words, the weekly fast food habit that was common in 2003 and 2006 became a monthly or twice monthly habit in 2013.</span></em></p>

				<p>A few days ago, I asked people the following question on my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ieltssimon/">Facebook page</a>:</p>
<p><em>When you "brainstorm" ideas for an IELTS essay, what is the number one rule?</em></p>
<p>Only one person gave an answer that was close to what I was looking for. Here's my answer to this question:</p>
<p>The key idea behind "brainstorming" is that you write down <em><strong>anything that comes into your head</strong></em>: good ideas, bad ideas, irrelevant ideas... just write them all down. You can organise them and cross out the bad ones later.</p>
<p>People who forget this 'rule' often get stuck because they are afraid that their ideas aren't good enough. Don't judge yourself at the brainstorming stage.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>In every year:</strong> what can we say was true in all three years on the chart? One possible answer: most Americans ate in fast food restaurants between once a week and once a month (the two middle categories have the highest bars in all three years).</li>
<li><strong>Across the years:</strong> is there a change or trend across the 10-year period? One possible answer: Americans ate in fast food restaurants less frequently in 2013 (once or twice a month instead of once a week).<br><span style="color: #ffffff;">mm</span></li>
</ol>

<p>Here's an overview paragraph using the ideas above:</p>

				<p>Try this useful technique for IELTS writing and speaking:</p>
<p><strong>Give an opinion, then follow it with a conditional sentence.</strong></p>
<p>Look at these examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>In my opinion, governments should invest more money in public transport. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">If</span> rail and bus services <span style="text-decoration: underline;">were</span> more reliable, fewer people <span style="text-decoration: underline;">would need</span> to drive.</li>

	<p>
				<p>When writing your task 1 introduction, there are two types of paraphrasing that you can use:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>"Word by word" paraphrasing</strong>: Use the task statement (from the question paper) as your template. Change the main words but keep the same sentence structure.</li>
<li><strong>"Loose" paraphrasing</strong>: Rewrite the task statement in a completely different way, making sure that the overall message is still correct.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's have a look at how we might paraphrase the task statement below using these two methods.</p>
<p>..........................</p>
<p><strong>Task statement</strong><br>The chart below shows how frequently people in the USA ate in fast food restaurants between 2003 and 2013.</p>
<p><strong>1. Word by word paraphrasing</strong><br>The bar chart illustrates the frequency with which Americans ate in fast food establishments from 2003 to 2013.</p>
<p><strong>2. Loose paraphrasing</strong><br>The bar chart gives information about fast food eating habits in the US over a 10-year period.</p>
<p>..........................</p>
<p>The first method ensures that we include all of the information, but the resulting sentence might seem a little 'forced'.</p>
<p>The second method is less precise (we haven't mentioned frequency or restaurants). However, we have shown that we don't need to copy the task statement, and the sentence might seem a bit more 'natural'.</p>
<p>Both methods are equally acceptable. Which one would you use? Or is there a way to blend the two methods?</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here are some questions about writing task 1, with my answer below each one.</p>
<p><strong>1) Can I write "A glance at the graph shows..." in my overview paragraph?</strong></p>
<p>No, I don't recommend using this phrase. It's not normal to use the word "glance" when describing graphs or charts, and it seems strange to me as a native speaker. If you try too hard to use 'original' words, your writing will probably seem forced, unnatural or inappropriate to the examiner.</p>
<p><strong>2) Can I write "the rate of" instead of "the figure for"?</strong></p>
<p>In many cases, no you can't. I like the phrase "the figure for" because it can be used instead of "the number of" e.g. "the number of people who live in cities" could be "the figure for people who live in cities". But I wouldn't write "the rate of people who live in cities". You have to be careful with the word "rate" - look it up on Google to find common uses e.g. unemployment rate, birth rate, crime rate, rate of change. Here's my tip: if you're not sure, don't use it.</p>
<p><strong>3) Can we use "the data of" instead of "the number of"?</strong></p>
<p>No. I would only use "data" instead of the word "information" e.g. "the chart gives/shows information about..." could be "the chart gives/shows data about...".</p>

<p><span style="font-size: small;"><em><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; -moz-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">Can you suggest some websites for vocabulary, idioms and phrasal verbs for IELTS?</span></em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">Here's another comment (written by shokhrukh) that answers this question:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><em><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; -moz-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">I often wonder why so many people look for vocabulary websites when they have one right under their noses: ielts-simon.com. If you went through all the lessons Simon has posted over the years and picked up all the great words and phrases along the way, I'm sure you'd be well on your way to getting band 7+ in IELTS.</span></em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; -moz-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">Obviously I agree with shokhrukh. I believe this website contains all the IELTS vocabulary that you need!</span></span></p>

	<p>
				<p>Let's compare some sentences with figures in different positions.</p>
<p>1) Figures at the beginning of sentences:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">10 million</span> people voted in the election.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A quarter</span> of the population voted.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">25%</span> of people voted in the election.</li>
</ul>
<p>2) Figures at the end of sentences:</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of people who voted in the election was <span style="text-decoration: underline;">10 million</span>.</li>
<li>The proportion of the population that voted was <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a quarter</span>.</li>
<li>The figure for people who voted in the election was <span style="text-decoration: underline;">25%</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For me, the sentences in the first group (with figures at the beginning) seem clearer and more natural. While it's good to vary your sentence structure, it's probably best to have the "figure at the beginning" structure as your first choice.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Students often ask me to explain why their scores have dropped. For example, one student got a band 7 in speaking last month, but his speaking score dropped to 6 this month. How is that possible?</p>
<p>You might think that the examiner has been too strict or has done something wrong, but this is probably not the case. The best explanation for fluctuating IELTS scores is <em><strong>performance on the day</strong></em>.</p>
<p>Some days you perform well: the topics in the exam seem to suit you, your brain seems to find good answers and remember good words or phrases, and you finish all parts of the test in the time allowed. Other days nothing seems to go right; you simply have a bad day.</p>
<p>Don't worry if your score fluctuates; this is completely normal. One day everything will go perfectly, and you'll get the scores you need!</p>
<p>Note: Your scores will also fluctuate if you keep changing the 'method' that you use.</p>

				<p>A student wrote to me the other day to ask about an IELTS book that she had bought. The book contained tips that were completely different from the tips that I give. The student felt confused and wanted to know which tips were right.</p>
<p>I see this problem all the time. Students use different books and websites that contain different tips and methods. The resulting confusion hinders* students instead of helping them.</p>
<p>Here's my solution to this problem: stop using so many different books and websites! Choose one website, or one book, or one teacher, and follow one consistent method. If you read contradictory advice in a different book, ignore it - it's just a different method.</p>

<p><strong>1) 'while' at the beginning of the sentence:</strong></p>

	<p>
				<p>A good way to write the main body (paragraphs 3 and 4) in your task 1 answer is by <em><strong>developing</strong></em> the two ideas that you wrote in the overview (paragraph 2).</p>
<p>To show you what I mean, I've highlighted parts of the answer below.</p>
<p>..........</p>
<p><em>The diagrams illustrate some proposed changes to the central area of the town of Islip.</em></p>
<p><em><span style="background-color: #c0ff80;">It is clear that the principal change to the town will be the construction of a ring road around the centre.</span> <span style="background-color: #bfdfff;">Various other developments with regard to shops and housing will accompany the building of this road.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="background-color: #c0ff80;">Looking at the map of Islip as it is now, we can see that a main road runs through its centre from east to west. The second map shows the planned pedestrianisation of this road. Traffic will be diverted on to a dual carriageway that will form a ring around the town centre.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="background-color: #bfdfff;">Currently there is a row of shops along either side of the main road. However, it appears that the shops along the north side of the new pedestrian street will be demolished to make way for a bus station, shopping centre, car park and new housing area. The shops along the south side of the street will remain, but it seems that the town’s park will be reduced in size so that more new houses can be built within the ring road.</span></em></p>

<p>Can you see what I've done? The first sentence of the overview (green) is developed in paragraph 3, and the second sentence of the overview (blue) is described in more detail in paragraph 4.</p>
<p><em><strong>Tip:</strong></em> Try reading all of the 'green' sentences together, then read the 'blue' sentences separately. This should help you to see how the overview and main paragraphs are connected.</p>

	<p>
				<p>People often argue that "there's no best method" with regard to learning a language, or perhaps with regard to IELTS preparation.</p>
<p>While I agree with the "no best method" idea to a large extent, I believe that we should add to this statement:</p>
<p>"There's no <em><strong>best</strong></em> method, but you still need to choose <em><strong>a</strong></em> method."</p>
<p>And perhaps we could add a bit more:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't keep changing methods. Find one that works and stick to it.</li>
<li>Trust the method of an 'expert' e.g. your teacher or someone who has already been successful.</li>
<li>There may be several good methods, but bad methods also exist. Choose a good method and avoid the bad ones!</li>

<p>The diagrams illustrate some proposed changes to the central area of the town of Islip.</p>
<p>It is clear that the principal change to the town will be the construction of a ring road around the centre. Various other developments with regard to shops and housing will accompany the building of this road.</p>
<p>Looking at the map of Islip as it is now, we can see that a main road runs through its centre from east to west. The second map shows the planned pedestrianisation of this road. Traffic will be diverted on to a dual carriageway that will form a ring around the town centre.</p>
<p>Currently there is a row of shops along either side of the main road. However, it appears that the shops along the north side of the new pedestrian street will be demolished to make way for a bus station, shopping centre, car park and new housing area. The shops along the south side of the street will remain, but it seems that the town’s park will be reduced in size so that more new houses can be built within the ring road.</p>

	<p>
				<p><em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Note: I'm re-posting this lesson because people keep asking me about 'difficult' words.</span></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Here's a useful question from a student who asked about "difficult" words and how to learn new vocabulary:</strong></em></p>
<p>Hi Simon. Reading your blog and studying your ebook, I’ve noticed your English is perfect, but you don’t use difficult words. Also, regarding the process of learning new words, some teachers say that we should write them on cards and write the adjective, noun, verb associated with the new word. Do you think this is a good idea?</p>
<p><em><strong>Here's my answer:</strong></em></p>
<p>I don't believe in the idea of a "difficult word" - any individual word can be learnt easily. What is difficult is using words together in phrases. So, I tell my students not to write down individual words, but to investigate how words work in real contexts. Instead of writing single words on cards, I'd write phrases or even sentences in a notebook. It's definitely a good idea to look for associated nouns, verbs and adjectives, but always try to find examples of how those words are used (just search for them on the Internet). Remember: it's easy to understand a word, but it's not so easy to use it in a range of full sentence contexts.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Model essays can be extremely useful because they show you what you are aiming for, and they contain good vocabulary and correct grammar. However, the model essays in some IELTS books seem to confuse students because they are written in too many different ways (so the 'method' isn't clear).</p>
<p>Although there is no 'right way' to write an essay, I think that you should find <em><strong>one</strong></em> way and stick with it. If you read a model essay that is written in a different way, don't worry! Use the essay for ideas and vocabulary, but don't change your method. Maybe you could even rewrite the model essay using <em><strong>your</strong></em> method.</p>

				<p>A student asked me about the use of 'being' in the following sentence.</p>
<p><em>"There is a danger of nuclear weapons <span style="text-decoration: underline;">being</span> obtained by terrorists."</em></p>
<p>Here's my (updated) explanation:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, imagine that the simplest version of this sentence is this: <span style="color: #7f007f;"><strong>"There is a danger of x"</strong></span> (in which x is a noun).</li>
<li>Now we can consider <span style="color: #7f007f;"><strong>"nuclear weapons being obtained by terrorists"</strong></span> as a big noun phrase.</li>
<li>The <span style="color: #7f007f;"><strong>"being obtained"</strong></span> part of this phrase can be called a passive gerund. It is not a verb or verb phrase, so the word "are" (are being) is <em><strong>not</strong></em> missing and cannot be added.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: When we use the phrase "there is a danger of...", there is a future implication. So, "there is a danger of x" means "there is a danger that x will happen".</p>
<p>Therefore, our sentence really means this:<br>- There is a danger that nuclear weapons <em><strong>will be</strong></em> obtained by terrorists" OR<br>- There is a danger that terrorists will obtain nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>I think this mistake is caused by people translating from their own languages. For example, I know that in French and Spanish, the verb 'be' is used when people want to say that they agree, so it looks something like "I am agree" or "I am agreed". It's not the same in English.</p>

	<p>
				<p>In Thursday's lesson I told you <em><strong>not</strong></em> to use words like <em>soar, rocket, shoot up, creep up, dive</em> and <em>plummet</em> in IELTS writing task 1.</p>
<p><strong>But what's wrong with those words?</strong></p>
<p>The problem with those words is that they are <em>too figurative</em> for writing task 1. Think about the normal use of these verbs (e.g. the bird soared into the air, the climber plummeted to his death). If you use these words to describe figures on a graph, it seems too sensational or exaggerated. This is why I prefer to stick with <em>increase, decrease, rise</em> and <em>fall</em>.</p>
<p><strong>So can we ever use these words to describe figures?</strong></p>
<p>If you're writing for a newspaper, yes you can! You'll often see phrases like this in newspapers: house prices soared, share prices plummeted, the price of petrol crept up. Newspapers and magazines love idiomatic and descriptive language, but this style does not suit academic graph descriptions.</p>

				<p>The advice that I gave yesterday, about considering alternatives to adverbs, doesn't apply to IELTS writing task 1. For example, look at these verb-adverb phrases:</p>
<ul>
<li>increase dramatically</li>
<li>rise steadily</li>
<li>decrease significantly</li>
<li>fall gradually</li>
</ul>
<p>These phrases are fine, and I use them all the time.</p>
<p>If you avoid adverbs in task 1, you'll end up using words like this: <em>soar, rocket, shoot up, creep up, dive, plummet</em>. These words are <em><strong>not appropriate</strong></em> for an academic-style report, so I recommend that you avoid them.</p>

<p>The advantage of a blog is that it can keep going and going (unlike a book or a course). Over the years, this blog has evolved as I've learnt more about students' problems, and as I've gradually refined my IELTS preparation methods.</p>
<p>The disadvantage of the blog is that the lessons aren't in a particular order, so there isn't a starting point or a step-by-step progression. However, I find this lack of structure interesting. I don't think we always need to study in a perfectly organised way. Perhaps the act of searching through the lessons and reading them <em><strong>in your own unique order</strong></em> makes the study process more engaging and creative.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Let's look at a few useful things in last week's <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/ielts-writing-task-1/">sample answer</a>.</p>
<p><strong>1) Phrases to begin main paragraphs</strong></p>
<p>These phrases aid coherence by telling us what each paragraph is about:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is clear that... (overview)</li>
<li>Looking first at the older age groups,...</li>
<li>At the other end of the age scale,...</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2) Paraphrasing of "attendances at hospital emergency care departments"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>visits made to hospital emergency wards</li>
<li>visitors to A&amp;E (accident and emergency) departments</li>
<li>emergency care attendances</li>
<li>attended A&amp;E wards</li>
<li>require emergency treatment</li>
<li>figures for A&amp;E visits</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3) Language for comparisons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the most frequent visitors</li>
<li>less than half as likely to</li>
<li>made the fewest visits</li>
<li>almost no difference in the figures for</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4) Language for describing changes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>there was a slight increase in</li>
<li>and this rose to almost... one year later</li>
<li>rose marginally from... to...</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5) Giving the figures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>roughly 65 out of every 1000 people</li>
<li>almost 70 attendances per 1000-population</li>
<li>around 30 attendances per 1000-population</li>
<li><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">from around 50 to approximately 52 per 1000-population</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">just over 20 per 1000-population</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; -moz-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">6) Easy verbs, but 'big' noun phrases</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">If you look closely at the answer, you'll see that the verbs are easy (e.g. were, was, rose, attended, made). However, there are lots of big noun phrases (e.g. hospital emergency wards, emergency care attendances, those aged 65 to 74). This is quite typical in IELTS writing task 1 answers.</span></p>

	<p>
				<p><strong>This is my sample description of the bar chart that you can see <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2018/04/ielts-writing-task-1-hospital-attendances-bar-chart.html">here</a>:</strong></p>
<p>The bar chart compares the number of visits made by people in six age categories to hospital emergency wards in Northern Ireland in the December of 2016 and 2017.</p>
<p>It is clear that elderly people and the youngest children were the most frequent visitors to A&amp;E (accident and emergency) departments. Also, there was a slight increase in the rate of emergency care attendances among all six age groups from December 2016 to December 2017.</p>
<p>Looking first at the older age groups, roughly 65 <span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">people, per 1000 population, aged 75 and over attended</span> A&amp;E wards in December 2016, and this rose to almost 70 attendances per 1000-population one year later. Interestingly, those aged 65 to 74 were less than half as likely to require emergency treatment, with around 30 attendances per 1000-population in both months.</p>
<p>At the other end of the age scale, the figures for A&amp;E visits by under-5s rose marginally from around 50 to approximately 52 per 1000-population over the one-year period. Children aged 5 to 15 made the fewest visits, at just over 20 per 1000-population in both months. Finally, there was almost no difference in the figures for emergency care attendances among people aged 16 to 44, 45 to 64 and 65 to 74.</p>

	<p>
				<p>With yesterday's advice in mind, let's look at some reasons why students don't write clear, coherent essays:</p>
<ol>
<li>They don't have a <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2018/03/ielts-writing-task-2-my-mental-picture.html">mental picture</a> of what they are aiming to produce.</li>
<li>They don't take the time to think about the question before they start writing.</li>
<li>They don't spend enough time planning. A few ideas are not enough; a good essay plan should be detailed and organised. Do some "clear thinking" before you start writing!</li>
<li>They are thinking about the big words, complex grammar and memorised phrases that they hope to use in the essay, instead of thinking about how to answer the question. You can't think clearly about the question if your brain is focused on these other things.</li>
<li>They are thinking clearly in their own languages, but they are not able to translate these ideas into 'natural' English.</li>
</ol>
<p>Can you see how important 'clear thinking' is? Everything that you write is a manifestation of the thoughts in your head. In other words, your writing demonstrates exactly how clear your thinking is.</p>

	<p>
				<p>On Tuesday I used part of a very interesting speech by a university professor. I could sum up his message in this way:</p>
<p><em>There's no difference between thinking and writing. We should teach people to write well so that they learn to think well.</em></p>
<p>Of course, the opposite must also be true: If you want to <strong><em>write</em></strong> clearly and coherently, you need to <em><strong>think</strong></em> clearly and coherently.</p>
<p>Ask yourself this: When I'm writing an IELTS essay, does my thinking feel clear, coherent and organised? Or do I feel confused and disorganised?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: small;"><em><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; -moz-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">Am I writing this phrase because it <strong>really</strong> expresses my ideas in response to the question, <strong>or</strong> am I just writing this phrase because I memorised it and because I want to 'show it off'?</span></em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">I believe you'll get a better score if you <em><strong>stop</strong></em> memorising 'show-off' phrases. Instead, work on building your knowledge of 'topic vocabulary', and focus on answering the question with relevant ideas.</span></p>

	<p>
				<p>I often use the phrasal verb 'tighten up' when I'm talking about improving essays. Here's what I mean when I use this verb:</p>
<p>- Make your writing clear, concise and succinct<br>- Remove anything that is irrelevant or vague<br>- Avoid unnecessary repetition<br>- Check that each sentence follows on logically from the sentence before it<br>- Make sure that your sentences&nbsp;<a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2015/08/ielts-advice-paragraph-movement.html">move your paragraphs forward</a></p>
<p>Think about the job of an editor (for a newspaper, magazine or book publisher). Editors check other people's writing and "tighten it up" so that it's easier to read. This is what you should try to do with your own writing.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here's some advice to help you avoid common mistakes in IELTS writing task 1:</p>
<ol>
<li>Don't copy the question for your introduction. You should <em><strong>paraphrase</strong></em> the question (i.e. rewrite it using some different words).</li>
<li>Don't forget to separate your paragraphs clearly.</li>
<li>Don't forget to write a good summary/overview of the information. A quick one-sentence conclusion is not good enough. I prefer to put the overview straight after the introduction, and I try to write 2 sentences describing the information in general. You won't get a high score if you don't write a good overview.</li>
<li>Don't describe items separately (e.g. 2 lines on a graph). You should always try to <em><strong>compare</strong></em> things if it is possible to do so. Instead of describing 2 lines separately, compare the 2 lines at key points.</li>
<li>Don't try to describe every number on a chart or graph (unless there are only a few numbers). A key skill in task 1 is being able to <em><strong>select</strong></em> the key information and describe or compare it well. I usually mention around 6 or 7 numbers in my main paragraphs.</li>
<li>Don't spend longer than 20 minutes on task 1. Practise spending 5 minutes on each of your 4 paragraphs. Stop yourself after 20 minutes; remember that task 2 is worth more marks.</li>

<p>Do you have a method or a way of approaching <em><strong>every</strong></em> part of the test? If you don't have a method, you're not as well prepared as you could be.</p>

	<p>
				<p>I've given this advice before, but I think it will be useful to look at an example of what happens when you describe lines separately.</p>
<p>In the first comment below last week's <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2018/04/ielts-writing-task-1-range-and-flexibilty.html#comments">lesson</a>, a student called Beyonce tried describing the three lines on <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2018/02/ielts-writing-task-1-only-6-sentences.html">this graph</a> separately. Here are Beyonce's main paragraphs:</p>
<p>..........</p>
<p><em>In 1997, the top spending category (at $260) was business visitors. It rose by about a third to peak in 2002/3, and then dropped by nearly half. In the decade to 2015, it fluctuated wildly but the trend remained flat.</em></p>
<p><em>Spending by those visiting friends or relatives began much lower and also peaked in the early 2000s and then, after falling back to around its original figure, recovered slowly but comparatively steadily, to end the period as the highest spending category at $250 per day, significantly more than its original value, and $40 above the final business figure.</em></p>
<p><em>The last cohort, people visiting friends or relatives, remained in third place throughout, and, apart from doubling early on, showed much less variability in general, trailing away in from its peak to a $140 endpoint.</em></p>
<p><em>..........</em></p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong></p>
<p>In a later comment below last week's lesson, Beyonce agreed that her description seemed "mechanical": most of her sentences seem to follow an <em>"It did this, then it did this"</em> format. And of course, the main problem is that there aren't any <strong><em>true</em></strong> comparisons between the three categories in her paragraphs.</p>
<p>Looking at Beyonce's writing, I can see that her level of English is very good. But if she experiments like this in her test, she's likely to get a lower score than she deserves. There's no need to experiment; just follow my advice and try to write like <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2018/03/ielts-writing-task-1-shorter-version.html">this</a>.</p>

				<p>A student called Wanda left a really good piece of advice in the comments area below Wednesday's lesson. I think it's worth repeating the advice so that more people read it.</p>

	<h4><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2018/04/ielts-writing-task-1-range-and-flexibilty.html">IELTS Writing Task 1: 'range' and 'flexibilty'</a></h4>
	<p>
				<p>If you look at the band 7 description for 'lexical resource' (vocabulary), you'll see the words 'range' and 'flexibility'. You need to use a range of vocabulary in a flexible way.</p>
<p>But how can we demonstrate 'range' in such a short piece of writing? And what does 'flexibility' really mean in this context?</p>
<p>Let's look at two aspects of my most recent line graph <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2018/03/ielts-writing-task-1-shorter-version.html">answer</a>.</p>
<p>1) Paraphrasing:</p>
<ul>
<li>average daily expenditure / daily spending / spent... per day</li>
<li>types of traveller / international visitors / travellers / people visiting / those visiting</li>
<li>holidaymakers / tourists / vacationers</li>
<li>friends or relatives / relations or friends / loved ones</li>
</ul>
<p>2) Repetition:</p>
<ul>
<li>spent the most</li>
<li>spent the least</li>
<li>spent an average of</li>
<li>spent around</li>
<li>spent less than</li>
<li>spent roughly</li>
<li>spending was at its highest</li>
<li>spending increased dramatically</li>
<li>spending suddenly fell</li>
<li>spending had risen to approximately</li>
</ul>
<p>For me, paraphrasing is probably the best way to demonstrate 'range' and 'flexibility'. You are using a range of vocabulary items and your English is 'flexible' because you are able to describe the same thing in a number of different ways.</p>
<p>Repetition is interesting, especially because most IELTS students see it as a bad thing. This is not always true!</p>
<p>If you're describing a graph that shows spending, it's almost impossible to avoid repetition of the words 'spent', 'spending' and 'expenditure'. However, if you use these key words in a variety of contexts (i.e. with different words around them), I think you are demonstrating 'flexible use'. You are showing that you are able to use the same word in a number of different ways. I would also argue that you are demonstrating 'control' or 'precision' if you can do this without making mistakes; repetition is not necessarily as easy as it looks!</p>

	<p>
				<p>In last Sunday's <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2018/03/ielts-advice-work-on-your-weaknesses.html">lesson</a> I suggested that you identify and work on your weaknesses. It's not always easy to identify your own weaknesses, so here are three tips to help you to expose them:</p>
<ol>
<li>Break each part of the test into smaller tasks. For example, you could spend time working on multiple choice questions in the reading test, idea generation for speaking part 2 (see yesterday's lesson), trend descriptions for writing task 1, or main body paragraphs for writing task 2. If you practise "small pieces" of the test, it's likely that you'll discover which "pieces" are problematic.</li>
<li>Put yourself under pressure. Some people only discover their weaknesses on the day of their real IELTS tests. A good way to create this kind of pressure at home is to give yourself less time than normal. For example, you could try to write a task 2 essay in just 30 minutes, finish a reading test in 50 minutes, or do a full listening test with no breaks (i.e. fast forward the recording every time there is a break). Going too quickly will expose your weak points, and then you can go back and analyse them.</li>
<li>Ask a teacher. If nothing else seems to work, you'll need to get some feedback from a teacher. Ask your teacher to identify the main weaknesses that are stopping you from getting a higher score.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Be careful with point 2 above. It's fine to test yourself or "go too quickly" <strong><em>occasionally</em></strong>, as a way to expose weaknesses, but you should spend most of your time preparing slowly and carefully.</p>

<li>In the year 2000, business travellers spent the most money per day.</li>
<li>Three different categories of visitors are shown on the graph.</li>
<li>The figures for all three categories fluctuated.</li>

	<p>
				<p>It's often the case that just one particular weakness is stopping people from getting a higher score. For example, the student that I wrote about yesterday had a problem with idea generation. His English was very good, but he struggled to think of good ideas, especially when under pressure.</p>
<p>I told him to stop writing essays and to spend time working only on his weakness (as described yesterday). In other words, we <em><strong>identified</strong></em> a weakness, we <em><strong>isolated</strong></em> it, and then we came up with a simple <em><strong>action plan</strong></em> to tackle it. Perhaps you can do the same.</p>

	<p>
				<p>I got chatting to a student in a café the other day, and he told me that his big problem was not being able to think of good ideas for writing task 2.</p>
<p>When I asked the student about how he practised for this part of the test, it became clear that he wasn't working on his weakness. He wasn't practising idea generation.</p>
<p>So here's a summary of the advice that I gave the student:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, watch my <a href="http://subscriptions.viddler.com/SimonCorcoran/fkvcqe">video lesson</a> about planning ideas.</li>
<li>Then print a big list of questions, like <span class="asset  asset-generic at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c01bb09fe099c970d img-responsive"><a href="http://ielts-simon.com/files/question-list.pdf">this one</a>.</span></li>
<li><span class="asset  asset-generic at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c01bb09fe099c970d img-responsive">The next time you're sitting in a café, take your list out and try brainstorming ideas for two or three of the questions.</span></li>
<li><span class="asset  asset-generic at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c01bb09fe099c970d img-responsive">Don't write an essay or even any sentences. Just note down ideas on a piece of paper.</span></li>
<li><span class="asset  asset-generic at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c01bb09fe099c970d img-responsive">If you can't think of good ideas in English, try thinking in your own language. Don't translate the ideas into English at this stage. Your only aim is to turn on the creative part of your brain!</span></li>
<li><span class="asset  asset-generic at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c01bb09fe099c970d img-responsive">Start with your real opinion. Ask yourself what you really think about the topic; if you were debating the topic with a friend, what would you say?</span></li>
<li><span class="asset  asset-generic at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c01bb09fe099c970d img-responsive">Start with examples. If the topic is 'unhealthy food', think about McDonald's or Coca Cola. If the topic is 'work', think about doctors, teachers, computer programmers etc.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="asset  asset-generic at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c01bb09fe099c970d img-responsive">Imagine spending 15 minutes each day just thinking of ideas, questioning your own opinions, and making notes on a wide range of IELTS topics. With practice, I'm sure you can turn a weakness into a strength!</span></p>

	<p>
				<p>Many students are concerned that the language they use might be too 'simple', so they try to find more 'difficult' words or phrases.</p>
<p>In my opinion, words and phrases are never 'difficult' in the way that a subject like mathematics can be difficult. Anyone can understand and learn a word or phrase. What <em><strong>is</strong></em> difficult about learning a language is <em><strong>building a large&nbsp;<a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2011/10/ielts-advice-your-repertoire.html">repertoire</a></strong></em> of words and phrases that you can use flexibly to express a wide variety of ideas.</p>
<p>Examiners don't really think in terms of 'simple' and 'difficult'. They look for:</p>
<ul>
<li>range and variety of vocabulary</li>
<li>detailed explanation of relevant ideas</li>
<li>ability to put groups of words together correctly (e.g. collocation)</li>
<li>accurate use of small words (e.g. articles) as well as big words</li>
</ul>

	<p>
				<p>In last Thursday's <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2018/03/ielts-writing-task-1-dont-practise-this.html">lesson</a> I showed you a graph that would <em><strong>never</strong></em> appear in an IELTS test. The reason why you won't see that type of graph is that it only has one line and there's nothing to compare it with.</p>
<p>IELTS line graphs always have two or more lines, and your job is to <strong><em>compare</em></strong> the lines; don't describe each one separately.</p>
<p>This also means that it is pointless to practise sentences like this:</p>
<p><em>"The percentage of x rose gradually between 2005 and 2008, and then remained stable for the following two years, before dropping again in 2011 and reaching its lowest point in 2012."</em></p>
<p>It's unlikely that you'll ever write such a long sentence about only one line on a graph. Hopefully you'll be too busy <em><strong>comparing</strong></em> figures for more than one line!</p>

	<p>
				<p>Yesterday I mentioned that people are writing some really intelligent comments below lessons here on the blog. Today I'd like to share a comment written by Kali. I think this is a great example of 'deep work'.</p>
<p>Kali took five of my task 2 essays and shared the following analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each essay averaged 13 sentences, the longest 32 words, the shortest 10 words.</li>
<li>One in three sentences was complex in the sense that it contained a subordinate, noun, or relative clause.</li>
<li>On average ONE of the following: "Though/although", "because", "whereas", "while", "whilst",or "if" occurred ONCE per essay.</li>
<li>"In conclusion" ONCE per essay.</li>
<li>"Also" almost ONCE per essay.</li>
<li>Either "On the other hand" or "however" ONCE per essay.</li>
<li>"This" (as a cohesion device) in two out of five essays.</li>
<li>"but" occurred on average once or twice per essay.</li>
<li>"or" comes up about twice per essay.</li>
<li>"and" seven times per essay on average.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's Kali's summary of the above analysis:</p>
<p><em>In my view, what this demonstrates is that Simon's writing is both normal, and that its simplicity is deceptive. There is comparatively little reliance on connective adverbs, such as "moreover" or "consequently", at the start of sentences. Although some sentences are technically and grammatically more complex, the complexity passes unnoticed to the average reader.</em></p>
<p>If you find this kind of analysis useful, read the third comment below <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2018/01/ielts-writing-task-1-paraphrasing-practice.html">this lesson</a> (written by csaj). This is a great example of how Google Books and Ngrams can help us.</p>

	<p>
				<p><em><strong>Here's a shorter version of the answer that I shared in last week's <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2018/02/ielts-writing-task-1-too-long.html">lesson</a>:</strong></em></p>
<p>The line graph compares three types of traveller to New Zealand between 1997 and 2017 in terms of their average daily expenditure.</p>
<p>It is noticeable that spending by these international visitors was at its highest between the years 2000 and 2003. Overall, business travellers spent the most per day, while people visiting friends or relatives spent the least.</p>
<p>In 1997, business visitors to New Zealand spent an average of almost $260 per day, while holidaymakers spent around $190 and people visiting friends or relatives spent less than $120. Over the following five years, spending by all three types of traveller increased dramatically, to peaks of around $330, $270 and $220. However, visitor spending suddenly fell again between 2003 and 2005.</p>
<p>From 2005 to 2015, the daily expenditure of business travellers and tourists fluctuated around the $200 mark, whereas people visiting relations or friends spent roughly 60 to 80 dollars less per day. By 2017, daily spending had risen to approximately $250, $210 and $140 respectively for vacationers, business people and those visiting loved ones.</p>
<p>(174 words)</p>
<p><em><strong>Task:</strong></em><br>Compare the answer above with the longer report that I shared last week. How did I manage to reduce my answer from 240 words to 174 words? What can we learn from the differences between the two answers?</p>

	<p>
				<p>Native speakers instinctively know which words work well together. In our native languages, we don't usually need to think about grammar because we have a vast store of 'correct' collocations and phrases in our heads; some people refer to these as 'chunks' of language. It's incredible how quickly our brains are able to retrieve these 'chunks' and piece them together to form sentences and express ideas.</p>
<p>Unfortunately most of us don't use our brains in this way when we're learning a second language. We learn grammar rules and individual words, and we fall into the trap of translating from our native languages. As a result, we often make the wrong word choices and produce 'unnatural collocations'.</p>
<p>Part of the solution to this problem, in my view, is to become a collocations collector! Collect groups of words that native speakers actually use (see yesterday's lesson for some examples). Write them in a notebook, reread them regularly, and try to use them when you're speaking or writing,</p>
<p><em>Note: How many collocations can you find in the paragraphs above?</em></p>

<p>I don't think many people would have time to write such a long answer in only 20 minutes, so let's try the following exercise.</p>
<p><em><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Task</span>: Edit the following report, reducing it to between 150 and 180 words.</strong></em></p>
<p>The line graph compares three types of traveller visiting New Zealand between 1997 and 2017 in terms of the average amount of money that they spent each day during their trips.</p>
<p>It is noticeable that overall spending by international visitors to New Zealand was at its highest between the years 2000 and 2003. Also, over the 20-year period shown, business travellers spent the most per day, on average, while people visiting friends or relatives spent the least.</p>
<p>In 1997, business visitors to New Zealand spent an average of just under $260 per day, while holidaymakers spent around $190 and people visiting friends or relatives spent less than $120. Over the following five or six years, spending by all three types of traveller increased dramatically, to peaks of around $330, $270 and $220 for the three respective categories. However, visitor spending suddenly fell again between 2003 and 2005.</p>
<p>Over the 10 years from 2005 to 2015, similar daily travel expenditure levels can be seen for both business visitors and tourists, with figures fluctuating around the $200 mark. By contrast, people who were in New Zealand to see friends or family spent roughly 60 to 80 dollars per day less than the other visitors over this time period. In the final year shown on the graph, 2017, the figures for average daily spending stood at approximately $250, $210 and $140 respectively for vacationers, business people and those visiting family or friends.</p>

	<p>
				<p>It was interesting to read about people's procrastination problems in the comments below last Saturday's <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2018/02/ielts-advice-procrastination.html">lesson</a>. I think we all experience these problems when we're trying to do something difficult.</p>
<p>Here are five tips that help me to fight procrastination:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Just make a start.</strong> If you've been procrastinating about writing an essay, for example, make it your goal to write the first sentence only. The hardest thing is to get started, and the idea of writing a full essay can be daunting. Put this idea out of your mind, and focus instead on writing just one sentence.</li>
<li><strong>Find a nice place.</strong> Whenever I have some difficult writing to do, I find it much easier to get started if I'm sitting in a café with a cup of coffee. It doesn't feel like such hard work when you're in a nice environment.</li>
<li><strong>Aim lower (at first).</strong> Sometimes our frustration is caused by the high expectations that we have. Instead of jumping into a 10-hour-a-day study programme, it's better to start with 10 minutes, then gradually do more each day.</li>
<li><strong>Get some help.</strong> It's hard to study alone, so try to find a study partner, teacher or someone who can occasionally check your progress and give you advice.</li>
<li><strong>Form a daily habit.</strong> For me, doing something every day is the ultimate weapon in the fight against procrastination. Doing something once a week (or even 5 times a week) doesn't work as well. There's something magic about daily practice: when a daily action becomes as normal as brushing your teeth, big changes start to happen!</li>
</ol>

	<p>
				<p>Here are two useful questions that people have asked me about the overview paragraph that I shared in last week's <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2018/02/ielts-writing-task-1-daily-spending-overview.html">lesson</a>, with my answers below.</p>
<p><em><strong>1) Are two points always enough for the overview? Can we add a third point?</strong></em></p>
<p>I believe that it's best to stick to just two main or general points, even if you can see other general trends that could be mentioned. Here are four reasons: First, I would rather describe two things <em><strong>well</strong></em> and then move on to the details. Second, I think the overview loses its impact if it becomes too long - it stops being a summary. Third, one of the requirements of task 1 is that you "select" information; you are not expected to describe everything. Finally, I like to have a method and stick to it, so I know what to do without having to think too much.</p>
<p><em><strong>2) Is it better to put the overview after the introduction or at the end of the report?</strong></em></p>
<p>Both positions are fine. However, I prefer to write the overview straight after the introduction for two reasons: First, I find it easier to describe general information before looking at specific details. Second, I know that the overview is very important. If you want a good score, you need to take the time to write a good overview; when people write the overview at the end, they often find themselves rushing and they do a bad job!</p>

	<p>
				<p>I'll share some tips on beating procrastination next weekend, but I thought I'd say just one thing about it today, and it's something positive.</p>
<p>The positive thing about procrastination is that <em><strong>it tells you what is important.</strong></em> The more you procrastinate and leave something for later, the more important that task probably is in your life. So, let your procrastinating guide you towards what needs to be done, and begin to confront that task now. You'll feel much better if you do.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Do you find it difficult to study as much as you would like to? Perhaps you make study plans but then decide to "do it later". This is what we call 'procrastination'.</p>
<p>Most of us procrastinate, put things off, or tell ourselves that we'll do it later, especially when the task is difficult and we feel stuck.</p>
<p>Let me know if procrastination is a problem for you (with regard to your IELTS preparation, or anything else), and we can discuss some ways to beat it.</p>

	<p>
				<p>On the line graph below, I've labelled the two <strong><em>main points</em></strong> or <em><strong>general trends</strong></em> that I'll describe in my overview. Look at the big red numbers 1 and 2.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c01b7c94bd1c1970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Overview" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c01b7c94bd1c1970b img-responsive" src="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c01b7c94bd1c1970b-500wi" title="Overview"></a></p>
<p>Point 1 refers to the years when all three lines were at their highest points. Point 2 refers to the line for "business visitors", who appear to have spent the most overall.</p>
<p>So here's my overview paragraph:</p>
<p>It is noticeable that overall spending by international visitors to New Zealand was at its highest between the years 2000 and 2003. Also, over the 20-year period shown, business travellers spent the most per day, on average, while people visiting friends or relatives spent the least.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Many people ask how long it will take them to get the score they need. The answer is that it depends on several factors.</p>
<p>One of the most important factors is your 'learning situation'. This includes:</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here's the question statement from last week's <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2018/01/ielts-writing-task-1-daily-spending-line-graph.html">lesson</a>:</p>
<p><em><strong>The graph below shows the average daily spend of three categories of international visitor to New Zealand from 1997 to 2017.</strong></em></p>
<p>An easy way to paraphrase this sentence (for our introduction) is to change its order. I'll try to put the part about "visitors to New Zealand from 1997 to 2017" before the part about "the average daily spend".</p>
<p>Here's my introduction:</p>
<p><em>The line graph compares three types of traveller visiting New Zealand between 1997 and 2017 in terms of the average amount of money that they spent each day during their trips.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Question:</strong></em><br>What was the key phrase that helped me to change the order of the sentence?</p>

				<p>Over the next few weeks I'll show you how I would describe the line graph below. Feel free to try it yourself, or to share your ideas in the "comments" area.</p>
<p><em><strong>Tip:</strong></em> Ignore the fluctuations. Focus on overall trends and a few key figures.<br><span style="color: #ffffff;">mm</span></p>

	<p>
				<p>Let's look at the grammar problems in last Sunday's <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2018/01/ielts-grammar-correct-the-mistakes.html">lesson</a>.</p>
<p>1. Don't write "growth population". You need to write "population growth".<br>2. You can't write "the number of public" because 'public' is uncountable.<br>3. Don't write "there was" when giving a future prediction.<br>4. You can't put "alike" before a noun, so "alike growth rate" is wrong.<br>5. Don't put "is" after a plural (prospects is), and you can't write "by meanwhile".</p>
<p>Here are my corrected versions of the sentences:</p>
<ol>
<li>Population growth in England is projected at 5.9%.</li>
<li>The number of people living in England is projected to grow by 5.9%.</li>
<li>There will be a 5.9% increase in England's population.</li>
<li>There are similar population growth trends in Northern Ireland and Scotland.</li>
<li>The population is expected to grow by 3.2% in Scotland and by 4.3% in Northern Ireland.</li>

	<p>
				<p>I think it's important to remember that you can never be 100% prepared for any exam. One of the aims of an exam is to take you out of your 'comfort zone' in order to find the limit of your current ability. There will always be surprises and difficult questions; otherwise everyone would get full marks.</p>
<p>So, don't worry if there are topics that you haven't studied, or words that you don't understand, and try not to get too nervous or frustrated. Just keep working hard, do your best, and try to enjoy the challenge of the exam!</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here's the sentence that I asked you to paraphrase in last Thursday's lesson:</p>
<p><em>Projected growth in England's population is put at 5.9%, while the predicted figures for Northern Ireland and Scotland are 4.2% and 3.2%.</em></p>
<p>And here are two easy ways to paraphrase it:</p>
<p><strong>1) Put all three figures together and use 'respectively':</strong></p>
<p>The populations of England, Northern Ireland and Scotland are expected to grow by 5.9%, 4.2% and 3.2% respectively.</p>
<p><strong>2) Divide the information between two sentences:</strong></p>
<p>It is predicted that England <span style="text-decoration: underline;">will see a 5.9% increase in</span> its population. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">By contrast</span>, lower population growth rates are projected for Northern Ireland, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">at 4.2%</span>, and Scotland, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">at only 3.2%</span>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> I've underlined a few other interesting features of sentence 2 above.</p>

	<p>
				<p>A good way to practise your task 1 writing skills is to take a sentence and try to rewrite it in several different ways.</p>
<p>Take this sentence for example:</p>
<p><em><span style="color: #111111;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; -moz-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">Projected growth in England's population is put at 5.9%, while the predicted figures </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; -moz-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;">for</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; -moz-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;"> Northern Ireland and Scotland are </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; -moz-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">4.2% </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; -moz-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;">and</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; -moz-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;"> 3.2%</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; -moz-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;">.</span></span></em></p>

	<p>
				<p>When learning something new, it's always best to start off slowly. If you want to master a skill, you need to learn the necessary techniques and practise them slowly before you can gradually build up speed.</p>
<p>This was the idea behind yesterday's lesson. Start by practising 10-minute plans for speaking part 2, and gradually reduce your planning time. If you practise enough, you'll become much better at thinking of ideas for this part of the speaking test, and you'll be able to use your minute more effectively on the day of your test.</p>
<p><em><strong>Tip:</strong></em> think about other parts of the IELTS test that you could practise slowly.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Probably the most important skill for writing task 1 is being able to describe numbers correctly. IELTS candidates make a lot of basic mistakes in this area.</p>
<p>Take the simple table below for example. It shows the percentages of people who used two different forms of communication in the year 2012.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c01a3fcbb0fe8970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Screen Shot 2014-02-12 at 14.50.37" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c01a3fcbb0fe8970b img-responsive" src="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c01a3fcbb0fe8970b-450wi" style="width: 450px;" title="Screen Shot 2014-02-12 at 14.50.37"></a></p>
<p>Can you write <span style="text-decoration: underline;">one correct sentence</span> to describe the numbers in the table? Here is the big mistake that examiners see all the time:</p>
<p><em><strong>In 2012, text message was 95%, while email was only 52%. </strong></em>(don't write this)<em><strong><br></strong></em></p>
<p>Can you see what the problem is here? Try translating the sentence into your language exactly as it is. Does it make sense?</p>

	<p>
				<p>In the comments below Thursday's <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2017/12/ielts-writing-task-1-using-model-sentences.html">lesson</a>, I noticed a useful question from nav, and a very thoughtful response from Kati. It's great to see people discussing things and helping each other in the comments below my lessons!</p>
<p>To add to Kati's response, I'd like to say a little more about using 'model sentences'. First, I'll quickly repeat two useful points from Kati's comment:</p>
<ol>
<li>As Kati points out, the 'model sentences' exercise is probably more suited to writing task 1. This is because task 1 is quite predictable: we know that we'll have to describe trends, compare numbers or describe steps, so we can practise specific types of sentence for these purposes (e.g. 'while' sentences, 'respectively' sentences etc.).</li>
<li>There are some sentence types that I repeatedly use in writing task 2 (e.g. a 'while' sentence in the introduction). See Kati's comment for links to lessons about these sentence types.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now here's the final tip that I wanted to add:</p>
<p>Try not to confuse 'model' sentences with 'template' sentences. Examiners don't like essays that are full of memorised template language (read <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2017/09/ielts-advice-warning-about-templates.html">this warning</a>).</p>
<p>On the other hand, <em><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">any</span> correct sentence can be used as a model</strong></em>. For example, we could take the first sentence of today's lesson ("In the comments below Thursday's lesson, I noticed a useful question.") and invent a new sentence that follows a similar structure or pattern (e.g. On the way home from yesterday's lecture, I read an interesting article in the paper.).</p>
<p>I think you could turn this into a great daily exercise. But the aim would be to improve your English, not to collect template sentences for IELTS.</p>

	<p>
				<p>On Thursday I suggested that you write some sentences using two of my own sentences as models. Here are the model sentences:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">More</span> waste goes to landfill sites <span style="text-decoration: underline;">than to any other</span> refuse management facility.</span></li>
<li>Austria and Belgium <span style="text-decoration: underline;">are the most</span> environmentally friendly <span style="text-decoration: underline;">of the</span> fifteen countries, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">recycling</span> around 60% and 50% of their waste <span style="text-decoration: underline;">respectively</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>And here are some sentences that people wrote in the 'comments' area below the lesson. Can you find and correct the mistakes?</p>

				<p>Some students have the mistaken idea that examiners compare candidates, and that you'll therefore get a lower score if you use words or phrases that "too many other candidates use".</p>
<p><strong>This is not true!</strong></p>
<p>Examiners are trained to mark candidates according to a defined set of criteria. For example, look at these phrases from the band descriptors for band 7 in writing task 2:</p>
<p>- addresses all parts of the task<br>- presents a clear position throughout the response<br>- logically organises information and ideas<br>- there is clear progression<br>- uses a sufficient range of vocabulary to allow some flexibility</p>
<p>You <em><strong>won't</strong> </em>find phrases like this in the band descriptors:</p>
<p>- too many candidates use ..... in their essays<br>- reduce the score if the word ..... is used</p>
<p>Remember: the only comparison that examiners make is between your answer and the band descriptors.</p>

<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">mm</span><br>The bar chart shows the percentage of waste that is recycled, put into landfill or incinerated in various EU countries.</p>
<p>If we look at the fifteen EU countries as a whole, it is clear that more waste goes to landfill sites than to any other refuse management facility. In fact, while around half of the countries put the majority of their waste into landfill sites, only two countries recycle at least 50% of the waste that they produce.</p>
<p>Austria and Belgium are the most environmentally friendly of the fifteen countries, recycling around 60% and 50% of their waste respectively. Germany, Sweden and Belgium also appear to have effective recycling programmes, resulting in roughly 40% of waste being processed in this way in each country.</p>
<p>Other EU countries recycle far less. Greece, Ireland and the UK, for example, only recycle around 10% of refuse, and put between 80 and 90 per cent of their waste into landfill. Finally, while most non-recycled waste in the EU area goes to landfill, four countries, namely Luxembourg, Sweden, the Netherlands and Denmark, incinerate more waste than they bury.</p>

	<p>
				<p>I'll finish the <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2017/10/ielts-writing-task-1-recycling-chart.html">waste chart</a> question next Thursday, but today I want to show you a 'real' example of some writing in the <strong><em>style</em></strong> of writing task 1.</p>
<p>Here are some sentences from a BBC article about the UK population:</p>
<ul>
<li>The UK population <span style="color: #8000ff;"><strong>was estimated to stand at</strong></span> 65.6 million in 2016.</li>
<li>2016 <span style="color: #8000ff;"><strong>saw</strong></span> the biggest UK population rise for 70 years.</li>
<li><span style="color: #8000ff;"><strong>Over the decade from</strong></span> mid-2016, projected growth in England's population is put at 5.9%, <span style="color: #8000ff;"><strong>for</strong></span> Northern Ireland <span style="color: #8000ff;"><strong>the figure is</strong></span> 4.2%, <span style="color: #8000ff;"><strong>while</strong></span> for Scotland and Wales the percentages are 3.2% and 3.1% <span style="color: #8000ff;"><strong>respectively</strong></span>.</li>
<li>The study puts projected UK population growth between 2015 and 2040 at 16%, <span style="color: #8000ff;"><strong>compared with</strong></span> 10% growth <span style="color: #8000ff;"><strong>for</strong></span> France and 4% for Germany.</li>
<li>The study also says that the number of people aged 85 and over <span style="color: #8000ff;"><strong>will have doubled from</strong></span> 1.6m in 2016 <span style="color: #8000ff;"><strong>to</strong></span> 3.2m in 2041.</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason why I wanted to share these sentences is that they are written in a very similar style to the style that I use in my model answers here on the blog. You'll see that I've highlighted some typical task 1 vocabulary.</p>
<p>If you'd like to read the full article, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-41761292">click here</a>. You might even notice a few mistakes in the original article - it was probably written too quickly!</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here's a piece of advice that I gave in a blog lesson a few years ago. I forgot that I had written this, and I think it's worth repeating:</p>
<p><em>In my experience, people become good at what they focus on. Are you constantly reading things in English, thinking about English, watching English videos, and making notes of anything new that you learn? If English is your main focus each day, I'm sure you'll improve.</em></p>

	<p>
				<p>Before you retake the exam, ask yourself some questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What specific areas have I worked to improve since my last exam?</li>
<li>How do I know that I have improved?</li>
<li>Can I get higher scores when I'm practising than the scores I need?</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's an example of an ideal response to these questions:</p>
<p><em>Since my last exam, I've been doing a lot of work to improve my 'main body' paragraphs for writing task 2. I now spend more time planning and organising my ideas before I start writing, so my paragraphs are a lot better. My teacher noticed this improvement and gave my most recent essay a band 7. I only need a 6.5.</em></p>

<p><strong>1) Figures for the two countries that recycle the most</strong></p>
<p>Austria and Belgium are the most environmentally friendly of the fifteen countries, recycling around 60% and 50% of their waste.</p>
<p><strong>2) Figures for recycling and landfill in Greece</strong></p>
<p>By contrast, Greece only recycles 10% of its waste and is the country that puts the highest proportion of refuse (90%)* into landfill.</p>
<p><strong>3) Figures for incineration in Denmark and Luxembourg</strong></p>
<p>Only two countries, Denmark and Luxembourg, incinerate over half of the waste that they produce; more precisely, figures for incineration are almost 60% and roughly 55% in the two countries respectively.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*It's ok to put numbers in brackets, but don't do this more than once or twice in your answer.</span></p>

<p>- No, not at all.<br>- Yes, definitely.<br>- Yes, unfortunately it does.<br>- Yes, many times.</p>
<p>After answering with these short phrases, I then explained my answers in more detail, using full sentences.</p>
<p>I think this is a nice technique that you could try. Start with a short "yes or no" answer (e.g. yes I do, no we don't, yes it certainly is...), and then explain your answer fully. Perhaps this technique will give you a few extra seconds to think before you give your full answer.</p>

	<p>
				<p>In last Saturday's <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2017/11/ielts-advice-the-power-of-repetition.html">lesson</a> I asked you to think about the power of repetition in terms of developing your English skills. Here are a few ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Listening:</strong> Listen to the same recording several times, but focus on something different each time you listen. I explained this idea <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2017/10/ielts-listening-listen-again-and-again.html">here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Speaking:</strong> Compile a list of questions, and practise answering them every day. Record yourself so that you can listen for mistakes, and make notes about how you could improve. The aim is to 'master' your list of questions before you move on to anything new.</li>
<li><strong>Reading:</strong> If you've done all of the tests in the official Cambridge IELTS books, do them all again, and again! It doesn't matter if you remember some of the answers; you'll still learn something new each time you do the tests. If you can 'master' every reading test in the Cambridge books, I guarantee you'll get a high score in the test (but you'll only master them if you repeat each test several times).</li>
<li><strong>Writing:</strong> Instead of writing four different essays (which will probably all get the same score), try rewriting the same essay four times. Each time you rewrite the essay, try to improve one aspect of it. For example, for the first rewrite you could work on grammar, then the second time you could try to add more detailed explanation, then for the third rewrite you could improve the vocabulary or the coherence.</li>
</ul>
<p>Repetitive exercises might seem like boring hard work, but I believe that you can use them as a form of 'training' to develop both your English skills and your exam skills.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Last week I showed you a "highest and lowest" overview, but I also said that a more general overview would have been better.</p>
<p>Let's look at the chart again:</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c01b7c9323f49970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="6a0120a5bb05d8970c01bb09d30b17970d-500wi" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c01b7c9323f49970b img-responsive" src="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c01b7c9323f49970b-500wi" title="6a0120a5bb05d8970c01bb09d30b17970d-500wi"></a></p>
<p>Instead of writing about the "highest and lowest" figures, let's describe something more general. For example, landfill seems to be the most popular form of waste management overall, and only two countries (Austria and Belgium) recycle at least 50% of their waste.</p>
<p>So, here's an overview using the observations above:</p>
<p><em>If we look at the fifteen EU countries as a whole, it is clear that more waste goes to landfill sites than to any other refuse management facility. In fact, while around half of the countries put the majority of their waste into landfill sites, only two countries recycle at least half of the waste that they produce.</em></p>

	<p>
				<p>In Thursday's <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2017/11/ielts-writing-task-1-overview-highest-and-lowest.html">lesson</a> about IELTS writing task 1, I wrote that it's ok to describe the highest and lowest figures in your 'overview' paragraph. However, thanks to a comment by Erika, I've realised that I should add some extra advice or some warnings about this:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, it's important to remember that the best type of overview is one that describes overall trends, rather than specific details. The highest and lowest figures on a chart are normally considered to be specific details, so they shouldn't be your first choice for the overview.</li>
<li>If you can't see a clear general trend, it's ok to describe the highest and lowest, but don't mention any numbers.</li>
<li>Look for the highest and lowest category overall, rather than a single highest or lowest point. For example, if you're writing an overview about a line graph, it's fine to say that one of the lines was highest for most of the period, but don't describe any specific peaks (save them for the 'details' paragraphs).</li>
</ul>
<p>The overview that I wrote on Thursday was fine because the main aim of the chart was not to show trends. Picking out the most and least environmentally friendly country made sense in this particular case, and I didn't mention specific numbers.</p>
<p>However, I want to make it clear that <em><strong>describing the highest and lowest should not be your first choice method for writing the overview</strong></em>. Look for overall trends first.</p>
<p><strong>Task:</strong><br>Next Thursday I'll show you an alternative overview paragraph for the "waste chart" question. Can you suggest which "main or general points" about the chart I could include, instead of describing the highest and lowest?</p>

	<p>
				<p>I've been thinking about the power of repetition (in the sense of practising the same thing many times) this week.</p>
<p>Young children (the best language learners!) love watching the same cartoon or reading the same book again and again. But as adult language learners we rarely do this; we move on to the next thing too quickly.</p>
<p>Let's think about how we can build some repetition into our IELTS practice. I gave you some ideas yesterday and on Tuesday, but what else can we do? Feel free to share your thoughts in the comments below, and I'll give you my tips next weekend.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Look again at the chart below, and think about what you would write in your 'overview' paragraph. Choose two main or general points.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c01bb09d30b17970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="6a0120a5bb05d8970c01b8d2b5f762970c-800wi" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c01bb09d30b17970d img-responsive" src="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c01bb09d30b17970d-500wi" title="6a0120a5bb05d8970c01b8d2b5f762970c-800wi"></a></p>
<p><strong>Here's a tip:<br></strong>I normally suggest that you look for something very general, like an overall trend, for the overview. However, if you're stuck, it's ok to choose the highest and lowest. In this case, I would choose the highest and lowest figures for recycling (i.e. Austria and Greece).</p>
<p><strong>Here's a 2-sentence overview using the tip above:</strong><br>It is noticeable that Austria is the most environmentally friendly country, in the sense that it recycles the largest percentage of waste. By contrast, Greece stands out as the country that recycles the least and puts the highest proportion of its waste into landfill.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em><br>I'll say a bit more about choosing the highest and lowest in Sunday's lesson.</p>

<ul>
<li>4 sentences: topic sentence then 3 advantages</li>
<li>Organising: I think... / First,... / Another benefit would be... / Finally, it seems to me that...</li>
<li>Good vocabulary: clear advantages, lack of traffic or industry, the average city, sense of community, everyone knows each other, the pace of life, laid back, the hustle and bustle</li>
<li>Interesting grammar: second sentence begins with a subordinate clause using 'with'</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Answer 3</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>3 sentences: direct answer, explanation, the opposite or alternative</li>
<li>Organising: Yes, think... / A visit can be both... and... / If schools don't offer...</li>
<li>Good vocabulary: both relaxing and educational, walks in the fresh air, may never have seen before, offer this opportunity, life outside the city</li>
<li>Interesting grammar: adding information using 'especially', use of semicolon to expand on one idea, first conditional sentence to imagine the alternative</li>

				<p>Instead of trusting the grammar 'rules' that you find in a book, why not do your own investigating to see exactly how a word or phrase is used by native English speakers?</p>
<p>This is what I was encouraging you to do in yesterday's lesson about the word "alike". Instead of explaining the grammar rules, I simply showed you some correct sentences that contained the word. I gave you a 'model' or 'pattern' that you can use to make your own sentences.</p>

	<p>
				<p><strong>Here's my answer for the 'silkworm' diagram task that you can see <a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/__IjoltOH0JU/THa1j13RMiI/AAAAAAAABFI/i4zin6ciwsA/s1600/DSC01394.jpg">here</a>.</strong></p>
<p>The diagrams illustrate the stages in the life of a silkworm and the process of producing silk cloth.</p>
<p>There are four main stages in the life cycle of the silkworm, from eggs to adult moth. The process of silk cloth production involves six steps, from silkworm cocoon to silk material.</p>
<p>At the first stage in the life cycle of a silkworm, the moth lays its eggs. Around ten days later, silkworm larvae hatch from the eggs; these larvae feed on mulberry leaves. Then, after four to six weeks, the larvae become covered in silk thread, and it takes between three and eight days for a full cocoon to be produced.</p>
<p>For silk cloth production, a cocoon is first selected and then boiled in water. After boiling, the silk thread that makes up the cocoon is unwound, and then several strands of thread are twisted together. At the fifth and sixth stages in the process, the thread can either be dyed and then woven into silk fabric, or it can be woven first and then dyed subsequently.</p>

	<p>
				<p>A fast way to test someone's ability to speak a language is to ask them to paraphrase something - to express the same idea in a variety of ways. Some students find this difficult, and they usually need more help with vocabulary and ideas. By contrast, the students who do this well tend to reach their IELTS goal much more quickly.</p>

	<p>
				<p>When describing a graph or chart, you almost never need to use the passive. However, you probably will use the passive when describing a process diagram.</p>
<p>Imagine we have a diagram that shows the process of recycling used glass. One step in the process is labelled "grinding machine" (<em>to grind</em> means to crush or reduce into small particles).</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c01b7c75a53f5970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Screen Shot 2015-03-05 at 12.44.03" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c01b7c75a53f5970b img-responsive" src="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c01b7c75a53f5970b-200wi" style="width: 200px;" title="Screen Shot 2015-03-05 at 12.44.03"></a></p>
<p>Do you know the past participle of the verb <em>grind</em>? If you don't, you won't be able to make a passive sentence. But don't worry; there are various ways to describe this step.</p>
<p><strong>Using a different verb:</strong><br>1. Next, the glass <span style="text-decoration: underline;">passes</span> through a grinding machine. (active form of 'pass')<br>2. Next, the glass <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is passed</span> through a grinding machine. (passive form of 'pass')<br>3. Next, a grinding machine <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is used</span> to crush the glass. (passive form of 'use')</p>
<p><strong>If you know the verb 'grind' and its past participle 'ground':</strong><br>1. Next, a machine <span style="text-decoration: underline;">grinds</span> the glass. (active)<br>2. Next, the glass <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is ground</span> in a machine. (passive)</p>

	<p>
				<p>From the comments that people wrote below Wednesday's <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2017/09/ielts-writing-task-2-template-language.html">lesson</a>, it seems that many students find essay templates useful. However, I think it's important to repeat the warning that I gave in my own comment below that lesson.</p>
<p><strong>Warning about templates:</strong></p>
<p>Templates can certainly be useful, as they can help us to quickly organise our ideas. Also, it is inevitable that we will need to use some 'linking' words and phrases in our essays.</p>
<p>However, there is also a danger that people focus more on the template than on answering the question with good ideas. Templates and linking are <em><strong>not</strong></em> the secret to a high score in the writing test. They just do a simple job - they help you to organise your ideas, that's all. In the end, your score will depend on the quality of language that you use to <em><strong>express ideas</strong></em>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> simply to <em><strong>organise</strong></em> them.</p>
<p>So, learn some basic template / linking / organising language, but don't become obsessed with it. Spend most of your time working on topic vocabulary and your ability to express and develop "real" ideas.</p>

<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">...</span><br>The bar chart and pie chart give information about why US residents travelled and what travel problems they experienced in the year 2009.</p>
<p>It is clear that the principal reason why Americans travelled in 2009 was to commute to and from work. In the same year, the primary concern of Americans, with regard to the trips they made, was the cost of travelling.</p>
<p>Looking more closely at the bar chart, we can see that 49% of the trips made by Americans in 2009 were for the purpose of commuting. By contrast, only 6% of trips were visits to friends or relatives, and one in ten trips were for social or recreation reasons. Shopping was cited as the reason for 16% of all travel, while unspecific ‘personal reasons’ accounted for the remaining 19%.</p>
<p>According to the pie chart, price was the key consideration for 36% of American travellers. Almost one in five people cited safety as their foremost travel concern, while aggressive driving and highway congestion were the main issues for 17% and 14% of the travelling public. Finally, a total of 14% of those surveyed thought that access to public transport or space for pedestrians were the most important travel issues.</p>

				<p>Did you notice the following sentence in Wednesday's essay? This is a nice way to introduce a personal example in the writing or speaking test.</p>
<p><em><strong>Having worked</strong> with children myself, I have learnt that clear expectations and boundaries are necessary.</em></p>
<p>Try creating your own personal examples with "having + past participle". You can also add the word "never" to make a negative. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Having lived</strong></em> abroad myself, I understand how important it is to learn about local customs.</li>
<li><em><strong>Having never tracked</strong></em> my fitness goals before, I found the new app really useful.</li>

	<p>
				<p>Yesterday a student asked me to recommend a good grammar book. My answer to this question is that <em><strong>you don't need one</strong></em>. Let me explain my reasons for this view.</p>
<p>When I was at school, language learning meant studying two things: 1) grammar rules and 2) lists of vocabulary. The idea was that we should use the grammar rules to construct sentences, and the vocabulary would fill in the gaps. To me this seemed like a "mathematical" approach, where each grammar rule is like a formula. If you use a grammar book, you're probably following this method.</p>
<p>Nowadays I prefer a different approach, especially when teaching IELTS. Here are <strong><em>five reasons</em></strong> why I've moved away from the "grammar book" method:</p>
<ol>
<li>I believe that students can pass the test more quickly if they remember that grammar only accounts for 25% of their score, and they focus instead on the other <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2017/03/ielts-advice-the-other-75.html">75%</a>.</li>
<li>I believe that the "mathematical formula" approach causes people to create unnatural sentences.</li>
<li>I think that a better use of your time is to read and listen to as much native-speaker English as possible, so that you pick up the words, phrases and constructions that English speakers really use.</li>
<li>If you want to improve your grammar for IELTS, I recommend that you ask a teacher to highlight your mistakes. Instead of learning rules from a book, just aim to learn from the mistakes that you make, and therefore gradually "edit" your English.</li>
<li>You can check any grammar point with a quick search on the Internet. There's no need to slowly work through a book any more!</li>

	<p>
				<p>On Wednesday I wrote about 'template language', and there's a useful comment from sjm (another IELTS teacher) below the lesson. Here's what he said:</p>
<p><em>The problem with a lot of templates is that they contain too many memorised words and phrases. This then lowers the amount of topic vocabulary. Simon even uses a basic template (for example, he uses a five sentence body paragraph with a clear topic sentence, and similar linkers). However the key is that a template (or what I would call 'good organisation') does not dominate the essay. I always say from an examiner's point of view that candidates should keep memorised words and linkers to under 20% of the total word count.</em></p>
<p><strong>This made me think:</strong> Which words or phrases in some of my own essays could we highlight as 'template language' or 'good organisation'?</p>
<p>If you have time, make a list of the template / organising language in the two essays linked below. We can then compare the two lists.</p>

				<p>When you are given two different charts, the overview paragraph is quite easy: just write one sentence about each chart, describing a main feature of each.</p>
<p>Here's the two chart task that we've been looking at in recent lessons:</p>
<p><em><strong><span style="color: #ffffff;">mm</span><br>The charts below show reasons for travel and the main issues for the travelling public in the US in 2009.<br><span style="color: #ffffff;">mm</span><br></strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong><span style="color: #ffffff;">mm</span><br>And here's my 2-sentence overview paragraph:</strong></em></p>
<p>It is clear that the principal reason why Americans travelled in 2009 was to commute to and from work. In the same year, the primary concern of Americans, with regard to the trips they made, was the cost of travelling.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em><br>I've used several examples of paraphrasing in the paragraph above (when you compare it to the question statement). Can you see them?</p>

	<p>
				<p>A full day of testing isn't easy, and you'll probably get a shock on your exam day if you've only practised individual parts of the test at home.</p>
<p>So, as part of your IELTS preparation, why not do a full day of testing at home, maybe once every two weeks? In the morning, start with a full listening test, then go straight on to a reading test, and follow that with both writing tasks. Have lunch, and then ask a friend or family member to be your speaking examiner in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Don't worry too much about your scores. Just get used to the difficulty of maintaining concentration for a full day. You'll be much better prepared when your exam day arrives if you've done a few of these mock test days at home.</p>

	<p>
				<p>If a teacher, website, book or friend tells you that you <em><strong>must</strong></em> do a particular thing in the writing test, you can check the band descriptors to see whether it's true.</p>
<p>For example, I often receive questions like this:</p>
<p>My teacher told me that I <em><strong>must</strong></em> add a second sentence, containing a recommendation or prediction, to my task 2 conclusions? Is this true?</p>
<p>Here's my answer:</p>
<p>No, this is not true. There's nothing in the band descriptors about conclusions needing a recommendation or prediction. I think it's fine for teachers to say "this is how I think we should write a good conclusion", but they should make it clear that they are giving <em><strong>advice</strong></em> rather than stating a rule. <em><strong>If it's not in the band descriptors, it's not a rule</strong></em>.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Thanks to those of you who wished me a happy holiday! I'm feeling refreshed after a week off, and I thought it would be a good time to share a positive message that I received from a student, called Evan, who passed the IELTS test this month.</p>
<p>Here are the main parts of Evan's message:</p>
<p><em>Dear Simon,</em></p>
<p><em>I received my IELTS result this morning, and I am so happy to share with you that I've achieved my goal (7.0 for every part). I started taking IELTS in October 2016, and this is my 5th attempt. I would like to thank you very much for your useful lessons, tips and advice on your blog and your video course. I could not have got the results without it. I also want to share with you my experience, and hopefully this could once again prove that if one follows your method, he or she will succeed one day.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>My journey to achieving my IELTS goal has been very difficult and frustrating as I have been stuck with either writing or reading, especially writing. At some points I almost gave up and was thinking that IELTS may not be for me.&nbsp;But when I felt down, I read your posts and comments from successful takers, especially James Z, Chanaka and Kevin, which inspired me to continue. After my 4th attempt, I decided to take time off work so I could devote all my time to study. I studied from 9am to 6.30pm from Monday to Saturday for 5 weeks, and I wrote 34 essays and 11 letters following your method, and had 6 essays and 2 letters corrected. This helped identify my common mistakes, such as grammar error and word choice, and also to give me an idea of what a band 7.0 in writing would look like. I focused on learning topic vocabulary, and I practised the keyword technique for writing and listening. I strictly followed your advice for speaking part 1 (short and easy), part 2 (vocabulary theme) and part 3 (flow).</em></p>
<p><em>After all, I think that the key to IELTS band 7 includes the following:</em></p>
<ol>
<li><em>Hard work always pays off.</em></li>
<li><em>Trust ielts-simon.com's lessons, you don't need any others, even books. In fact, I only used the 12 Cambridge books and Official Practice Materials from ielts.org.</em></li>
<li><em>Don't waste time and money to take the test repeatedly. Instead, concentrate on language learning, and take the test when you are ready.</em></li>
<li><em>Spend more time on studying and practising than testing (I found this advice from you the most useful).</em></li>
<li><em>Have someone to check your work to identify common mistakes.</em></li>
</ol>
<p><em>Once again, thank you Simon very much and I really appreciate your work. Now,I can go back to work while preparing for the next chapter of my life with my IELTS result.</em></p>
<p><em>Regards,</em><br><em>Evan</em></p>

	<p>
				<p>A student pointed out that I often use the word 'get' in my sample answers for IELTS speaking. For example, I wrote "get cash out" in my answer to question 4 in yesterday's lesson.</p>
<p>So, is it acceptable to use the word 'get' or is it too informal? Here's my answer:</p>
<p>The word 'get' is used so often in spoken English that no native speaker (or examiner) will even notice that you've used it. In fact, it might even help to make your speech sound more fluent and natural if you use 'get' in your speaking test.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> 'get' is fine in the speaking test, but I would normally avoid using it in the writing test.</span></p>

<p><strong>Task achievement</strong><br>The answer fulfils the requirements of the task by giving a clear overview of the main trends shown in the table, and by presenting key details. Good comparisons are made between the two schools and the two years.</p>
<p><strong>Coherence and cohesion</strong><br>Paragraphing is clear, information is presented in a logical order, and cohesion (e.g. linking and comparing) does its job without attracting too much attention.</p>
<p><strong>Lexical resource</strong><br>A wide range of vocabulary is used in a natural and sophisticated way, with no mistakes. Some less common items of vocabulary are used.</p>
<p><strong>Grammatical range and accuracy</strong><br>Most importantly, there are no mistakes in the answer. A range of sentence structures is used with full flexibility and accuracy.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em><br>Can you find some examples of good cohesion (linking / comparing) and less common vocabulary in my answer?</p>

	<p>
				<p><em><strong>Here's my full answer for the table task shown in <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2017/06/ielts-writing-task-1-educational-problems-table.html">this lesson</a>:</strong></em></p>
<p>The table compares two primary schools in terms of the proportions of their pupils who experienced seven different educational problems in the years 2005 and 2015.</p>
<p>It is noticeable that school A had higher proportions of children with all seven educational difficulties in both years. However, while school A managed to reduce the incidence of most of the problems between 2005 and 2015, school B saw an overall rise in the percentage of children who were struggling.</p>
<p>In 2005, 42% of school A’s pupils found it difficult to follow instructions, whereas only 6% of pupils in school B experienced this problem. Similarly, between 30 and 40 per cent of children attending school A had problems in the areas of spelling, listening, verbal expression and concentration in lessons, while the equivalent figures for school B stood at between 5 and 15 per cent.</p>
<p>In 2015, the difference between the two schools was less pronounced. Notably, the proportion of children who struggled to follow instructions fell by 24% in school A, and this school also saw falls of 22%, 15%, 14% and 5% in the figures for children who had problems with concentration, listening, verbal expression and spelling. In school B, however, the proportion of children who struggled with spelling and following instructions doubled, to 10% and 12% respectively, and there was almost no change in the incidence of listening, verbal or concentration problems.</p>

	<p>
				<p>When the graph, chart or table shows a lot of information, it's difficult to decide what to put in your main 'details' paragraphs.</p>
<p>Here's a method that I often use to help me with this decision: <em><strong>expand on the two points that you made in your 'overview' paragraph</strong></em>.</p>
<p>For example, look at <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2017/06/ielts-writing-task-1-educational-problems-answer.html">this lesson</a>. We can use the two points in the overview paragraph to guide our decisions about what to put in paragraphs 3 and 4:</p>
<p><strong>Paragraph 3</strong><br>Expand on the sentence about school A having higher proportions of children with educational problems. In other words, we can make some easy comparisons between school A and B. Don't worry about changes in the figures or comparing the two years.</p>
<p><strong>Paragraph 4</strong><br>Now expand on the sentence about changes i.e. falling percentages in school A and rising figures in school B.</p>
<p>I'll use this technique to write my full answer next week.</p>

	<p>
				<p><strong>Studying alone</strong></p>
<p>It's certainly possible to prepare for the IELTS test alone. Every week I receive messages from people who tell me that they passed the test without attending any "normal" lessons. Some of them used only the free lessons here on the blog, while others found my video course to be exactly what they needed.</p>
<p><strong>Taking lessons</strong></p>
<p>On the other hand, not everyone likes working independently. You might find that attending English lessons with a teacher suits you better. The good news is that your teacher <em><strong>doesn't need to be an IELTS expert</strong></em>. You already have all the IELTS advice that you need here, so just try to find a good "general English" teacher.</p>
<p><strong>A middle point</strong></p>
<p>A "middle point" between the two paths above could be to study alone but get some feedback from an IELTS teacher every now and then. For example, you could study my blog lessons, and then <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2016/10/essay-correction-and-speaking-practice.html">get an essay checked</a> or try taking a realistic <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2016/10/essay-correction-and-speaking-practice.html">online speaking test</a> with one of my colleagues. If you're working alone, a teacher's feedback will make sure you're on the right track.</p>

				<p>Let's look at the first two paragraphs of my model answer for the task below.</p>
<p><em><strong>The table below gives information about the problems faced by children in two primary schools in 2005 and 2015.</strong></em></p>

				<p><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(mindset = established set of attitudes or way of thinking)</span></p>
<p>It seems to me that too many students have a <em><strong>"grammar mindset"</strong></em>. They believe that 'complex structures' are the key to a high IELTS score, and they focus on learning grammar rules and linking phrases.</p>
<p>I prefer the<strong> <em>"vocabulary mindset"</em></strong>. Students who have this mindset are more concerned about how native speakers <span style="text-decoration: underline;">really</span> use the language. They 'collect' words, phrases and collocations by doing lots of reading and listening, and they enjoy using the new vocabulary that they have 'copied' from these sources.</p>
<p>To me, the vocabulary mindset seems much more positive and proactive than the grammar mindset. It seems less critical and more curious, and I also think that it makes language learning more fun!</p>

	<p>
				<p>In this lesson I'll try to answer Kami's question (see yesterday's lesson). Let's start by looking at the sentence below in more detail.</p>
<p><em>Fierce debates have been provoked if assignments ought to be done by students.</em></p>
<p><strong>Grammar</strong><br>There's really only one grammar mistake in the sentence above: the word "if" is used wrongly. We would need to write something like this: "Fierce debates have been provoked <strong><em>about the issue of whether</em></strong> assignments..."</p>
<p><strong>Vocabulary</strong><br>However, vocabulary is the real problem in the sentence:</p>
<ol>
<li>The word <strong><em>fierce</em></strong> is much too strong, and seems unnatural or inappropriate in this context. Are people really having fierce (i.e. furious, very angry) debates about homework?</li>
<li>I would also question the use of the word <strong><em>debates</em></strong>. Are people really debating this homework issue? Maybe they are, but this still seems a little exaggerated to me.</li>
<li>Next, while it isn't grammatically wrong, I would question the use of the word <em><strong>provoked</strong></em>. Has someone or something provoked this debate?</li>
<li>Finally, <em><strong>assignments</strong></em> are not necessarily the same thing as homework. Assignments can be done in the classroom, so the use of this word confuses the issue.</li>
</ol>
<p>While the grammar of the original sentence was <em>almost</em> correct, any native English speaker would find the sentence strange or unnatural, due to the vocabulary issues mentioned above. There's nothing "advanced or complex" about choosing inappropriate or exaggerated words that no English speaker would use.</p>
<p><strong>Final tip:</strong><br>It's good to be fascinated by new words and phrases, but using them correctly and appropriately is a different challenge. For most people, trying to write like an English-speaking journalist or novelist is like trying to play football at the level of Messi or Ronaldo! If you aim for such a high level, you're likely to make big mistakes.</p>

<p>Here's what I think about these problems: they are out of your control, so it's best to ignore them. Instead, you should focus on your own performance only - this is something that you <strong><em>can</em></strong> control.</p>
<p>In the right frame of mind, we are all capable of performing well under pressure. We can ignore other people and external distractions, and we can focus on the job that needs doing. Approach the test as a "professional" - if you've prepared properly, you're ready to get the job done!</p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #ffffff;">...</span><br>Here's my band 9 answer:</strong></p>
<p>The line graph compares the average price of a barrel of oil with the food price index over a period of 11 years.</p>
<p>It is clear that average global prices of both oil and food rose considerably between 2000 and 2011. Furthermore, the trends for both commodities were very similar, and so a strong correlation (93.6%) is suggested.</p>
<p>In the year 2000, the average global oil price was close to $25 per barrel, and the food price index stood at just under 90 points. Over the following four years both prices remained relatively stable, before rising steadily between 2004 and 2007. By 2007, the average oil price had more than doubled, to nearly $60 per barrel, and food prices had risen by around 50 points.</p>
<p>A dramatic increase in both commodity prices was seen from 2007 to 2008, with oil prices reaching a peak of approximately $130 per barrel and the food price index rising to 220 points. However, by the beginning of 2009 the price of oil had dropped by roughly $90, and the food price index was down by about 80 points. Finally, in 2011, the average oil price rose once again, to nearly $100 per barrel, while the food price index reached its peak, at almost 240 points.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Sometimes it's better <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> to look at word usage from a grammar perspective. Instead, we can accept that some phrases are 'fixed', and there's no point worrying about the individual words within them.</p>
<p>The phrase <em><strong>"I look forward to seeing you"</strong></em>, from yesterday's lesson, is a good example. There's no point trying to understand why we use "to + ing" in this phrase. Just learn it as a fixed phrase.</p>
<p>Let's take another example. Someone asked me for a grammatical explanation of my use of the word "for" in the sentence below:</p>
<p><em>One option would be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">for</span> police officers to visit schools.</em> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(taken from <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2015/09/ielts-writing-task-2-strong-opinion-essay.html">this essay</a>)</span></p>
<p>Here's the answer that I gave the student:</p>
<p>It might be best to learn the whole phrase "one option would be for x to..." without trying to understand it word by word. You could consider this to be a 'fixed phrase'.</p>
<p>In other words, rather than looking at this from a grammar perspective, you could learn it as a vocabulary item. Then, the best way to understand the phrase is to see it used in various different contexts. Here are some examples from a Google search:</p>
<ul>
<li>One option would be for national authorities to intervene.</li>
<li>In order to improve the economy, one option would be for the government to invest in infrastructure.</li>
<li>One option would be for staff to work more hours.</li>
</ul>

	<p>
				<p>Many students have learnt that 'to' can't be followed by a word ending in 'ing'. But you might have noticed that I break this 'rule' in some of my essays. For example:</p>
<p>"strict punishments for driving offences are <strong>the key <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to</span> reduc<span style="text-decoration: underline;">ing</span></strong> traffic accidents"</p>
<p>This phrase is completely correct, so it must mean that the "rule" was wrong! You <span style="text-decoration: underline;">can</span> put 'to' with 'ing' in many situations. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>The key to being more productive is...</li>
<li>I look forward to seeing you.</li>

				<p>Yesterday I showed you a 'bad' conclusion template, but what does a 'good' template look like?</p>
<p>One way for me to answer this is to recommend that you forget about templates completely. Just use the shortest, most basic 'organising' phrases, like "In conclusion", and focus on answering the question. In other words, you should worry about 'topic language', not 'template language'.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you really want a template for conclusions, have a look at <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2011/11/ielts-writing-task-2-conclusions.html">this lesson</a>. The templates you'll see there are acceptable.</p>

	<p>
				<p>After writing your introduction and overview paragraphs, you need to describe the information in detail. Here are my tips for describing line graph details:</p>
<ol>
<li>Try to write two paragraphs. This isn't a 'rule', but it's a good idea because it forces you to group the information, and this should improve the organisation and coherence of your report. One big paragraph full of numbers can look messy, whereas two separate paragraphs will look neater and be easier to read.</li>
<li>Aim for just two or three sentences in each 'details' paragraph. Some of your sentences will be quite long, because you'll be comparing several numbers, so two sentences can sometimes be enough.</li>
<li>Always compare the lines; never describe each line separately.</li>
<li>Select key numbers only. You won't have time to describe every number in every year.</li>
<li>Start at the beginning, with the first year on the left of the x axis. Compare the numbers (i.e. all lines) in that year.</li>
<li>Then choose an interesting point towards the middle of the graph, and compare the figures at that point.</li>
<li>OR: Summarise the line trends over the first half of the period (to somewhere around the middle of the graph).</li>
<li>Then start a new paragraph for the second half of the time period.</li>
<li>Compare the figures for all of the lines at any key points. Or summarise the line trends over the second half of the period.</li>
<li>Finish at the end, with the last year shown. Compare the numbers (i.e. all lines) in that year.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here's a short version of the advice above:</p>
<p><strong>Paragraph 3</strong><br>Compare the lines (giving numbers) in the first year shown, then describe any significant numbers or overall trends in the first half of the time period.</p>
<p><strong>Paragraph 4</strong><br>Describe any significant numbers or overall trends in the second half of the time period, then compare the lines (giving numbers) in the last year shown.</p>
<p><em><strong>Task:</strong></em><br>See if you can follow this advice to write two 'details' paragraphs about the line graph in last week's <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2017/04/ielts-writing-task-1-graph-introduction-and-overview.html">lesson</a>.</p>

	<p>
				<p>What do examiners consider to be "memorised language", and how will your score be affected if you use it?</p>
<p><strong>Words</strong><br>Individual words will not be considered memorised. However, if you have learnt some "big" words, you should make sure that you can use them in a natural and appropriate way, because incorrect use of words will affect your vocabulary score.</p>
<p><strong>Phrases</strong><br>It's fine to memorise and use "<a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2015/02/ielts-advice-collocations-and-topic-vocabulary.html">topic vocabulary</a>" phrases (e.g.&nbsp;<em>the opportunity to engage face-to-face</em>) and short organising phrases (e.g. <em>people have different views about</em>...). However, I recommend that you avoid learning <strong><em>long</em></strong> "<a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2016/10/ielts-advice-phrases-for-any-essay.html">any essay</a>" phrases (e.g. ... <em>is a controversial and hotly debated issue in today's world</em>). These "phrases for any essay" are very obvious to the examiner, and you'll probably get a lower score if you use them.</p>
<p><strong>Sentences</strong><br>Again, "topic vocabulary" is fine, but "any essay" sentences are not. So, if the question is about environmental problems, you can use a full sentence from my blog (e.g. <em>Human activity is a major factor in the rise of the greenhouse gases that cause global warming</em>). Having said that, it isn't easy to memorise full sentences for a wide range of topics, so I advise people to learn shorter "topic" phrases instead.</p>
<p><strong>Paragraphs and full essays</strong><br>If you write a perfect paragraph or full essay from memory and it fits the question, the examiner will not know and you will not be penalised. However, you would need to memorise hundreds of essays, so I don't recommend that you take this approach! Furthermore, if you write a perfect essay but it doesn't match the question, you will score zero!</p>
<p><strong>My final tip</strong><br>I recommend that you learn words and phrases (and maybe a few full sentences) for common IELTS topics, as well as some simple words and phrases for linking and organising your ideas. <strong><em>Don't</em></strong> learn lists of "phrases for any essay".</p>

	<p>
				<p>If you use words, phrases or sentences from this website or from my ebook, will the examiner know that you have copied me, and therefore consider part of your answer to be memorised?</p>
<p>The answer is <strong>no</strong>! You can, and you should, use the language that you find on this site. If you can't use the language that a teacher gives you, how are you expected to learn English?</p>
<p>For example, look at the following sentence from my most recent essay:</p>
<p><em>"Students may not have the opportunity to engage face-to-face with their teachers."</em></p>
<p>It would be fine to use a word (e.g. engage) or a phrase (e.g. the opportunity to engage face-to-face) from this sentence. You can even use the whole sentence, as long as it's relevant to the question that you have been asked.</p>
<p>So what do examiners consider to be "memorised language"? I'll explain that in tomorrow's lesson.</p>

	<p>
				<p>The overview / summary is a very important part of your task 1 report. Many people have no trouble describing specific details, but they find it difficult to describe the <em><strong>general features</strong></em> of a graph, chart or diagram. So here are my tips on how to write a good overview:</p>
<ol>
<li>Always try to write two sentences. This forces you to describe <strong><em>two</em></strong> main or general features of the graph, chart or diagram.</li>
<li>Don't put any numbers in your overview. Save specific numbers for the 'details' paragraphs.</li>
<li>If the graph or chart shows a time period (e.g. years), look for the overall change from the beginning to the end of the period (e.g. from the first year to the last year).</li>
<li>Look for overall trends, and ignore individual figures that don't fit the trend. For example, if a graph shows a rising trend overall, you can ignore a specific year when the figures decreased - save that year for your 'details' paragraphs.</li>
<li>If no time period is shown, you can't look for trends. Instead, look for <em><strong>differences and similarities</strong></em> between items.</li>
<li>Don't look for individual 'highest' or 'lowest' figures such as a 'peak' on a line graph. Instead, describe the highest and lowest items overall (e.g. which line on the graph was the highest for the <em><strong>whole</strong></em> or most of the period?).</li>
<li>Start your overview with a simple phrase that clearly shows the examiner that this is your summary paragraph e.g. It is clear that... , It is noticeable that... , Overall we can see that...</li>
<li>If there are two <strong><em>different</em></strong> charts, write one overview sentence about each chart.</li>
<li>If there are more than two charts, they must be connected in some way, so look for two main features overall.</li>
<li>If the task is to describe a diagram or map that compares things, you can mention the main differences and maybe the number of differences and / or similarities between the two diagrams.</li>
<li>If the task is to describe a process diagram, you can mention the total number of stages in the process and say where or how the process begins and ends.</li>
</ol>
<p>To get a much better understanding of this advice, go through my task 1 lessons here on the blog and analyse the second paragraph of any full answer that you find. Alternatively, watch my task 1 video lessons on <a href="http://subscriptions.viddler.com/SimonCorcoran">this website</a>.</p>

	<p>
				<p>People often ask me why I put the overview (summary) after the introduction instead of at the end of my task 1 reports.</p>
<p>I tell my students that they can choose where to put the overview. It's fine to put it after the introduction, and it's fine to put it at the end - your score will be the same either way.</p>
<p><strong>However, there are 2 reasons why I personally prefer to put the overview after the introduction, rather than at the end:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>I find it easier and more logical to begin with the general information and main features before I describe specific details.</li>
<li>The overview is very important, so I think we should prioritise it. If you want a high score, your overview / summary needs to be good, not something that you write in a hurry when your time is running out.</li>

<p>In the writing test, the other 75% comes from your ideas, vocabulary and essay organisation. In the speaking test, the 75% comes from your fluency and coherence, vocabulary and pronunciation. Why not spend more time on those things instead of worrying so much about grammar?</p>

<p><em><strong>The diagram below shows the life cycle of a salmon, from egg to adult fish.</strong></em></p>

<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">...</span><br>The diagram illustrates the stages in the life of the salmon, from birth to maturity.</p>
<p>It is clear that there are six* main stages as the salmon develops from egg to mature adult. We can also see that salmon spend time in three distinct locations during the cycle, moving from river to estuary to ocean and then back upstream.</p>
<p>Salmon begin their lives in rivers where the adult fish lay and incubate their eggs. After emerging from eggs, the young salmon spend the next stage of their lives being reared in freshwater areas. Then, at some point in their development, the fish swim downstream to river estuaries where rearing continues.</p>
<p>Following the estuary rearing period, the maturing salmon migrate to the ocean, where they eventually become fully grown adults. Finally, the adult fish travel back upstream to spawning areas of rivers; here they reproduce and lay their eggs, and the life cycle begins anew.</p>
<p>(154 words, band 9)</p>

	<p>
				<p>I've written about this many times before, but I still hear from many people who think that the way to get a higher score is by using big, difficult or 'original' words.</p>
<p>For example, a student commented recently that she had improved her English by learning the words <em>ameliorate</em>, <em>juggernaut</em> and <em>katzenjammer</em>. I can honestly say that I had never seen or heard the word 'katzenjammer' before. My dictionary says that it is an informal and old-fashioned word that was used in the US, which explains why I didn't know it. If you use a word like that in your IELTS essay, your writing will look very strange!</p>

	<p>
				<p>Some IELTS students spend a lot of time preparing "difficult" sentence structures to impress the examiner. One particular issue that people ask me about is the use of 'compound' and 'complex' sentences.</p>
<p>The first thing I would say about compound and complex sentences is that they are not "difficult". Here in the UK, children learn about these sentence structures in primary school (<a href="http://www.theschoolrun.com/what-are-simple-compound-and-complex-sentences-0">click here</a> to see how children are taught to understand sentence types). If you use words like <em><strong>and, but, because, although, while, when</strong></em> to connect ideas, you will automatically write a longer sentence that will be either compound or complex.</p>
<p>The second thing I would say is that you should not be worrying about these things when you are writing an IELTS essay. Just focus on answering the question and explaining your ideas well. I'm sure you'll naturally use "connecting" words to join ideas and create some longer sentences, so there's no need to worry about this at all.</p>

	<p>
				<p>How do you write an overview or summary about a 'life cycle' diagram? Here are two things that I always do:</p>
<p>1. Count the number of stages in the life cycle.<br>2. Decide on a beginning and an end point in the cycle.</p>

	<p>
				<p>The word "culture" is tricky because it can be used as an uncountable or a countable noun. It also has various meanings. A better understanding of this word will help you with the <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2017/02/ielts-writing-task-2-three-possible-introductions.html">writing task</a> that we've been working on, so let's look at some definitions and uses.</p>
<p><strong>1. Culture (uncountable): don't use with "a", don't make it plural<br></strong></p>
<p>This means the customs, beliefs, way of life, art, music, literature or social organisation of a group of people.</p>
<p>For example:<br>- I'm studying European culture. (everything from beliefs to art)<br>- This city is full of culture and history. (art, old buildings, traditional food etc.)</p>
<p><strong>2. Culture (countable): a culture / different cultures</strong></p>
<p>When we make 'culture' countable, we are <em><strong>usually*</strong></em> talking about the group of people itself. So, 'a culture' can be similar to 'a society' or 'a community'.</p>
<p>For example:<br>- Children are taught to respect different cultures. (different groups of people)<br>- Traditional cultures are disappearing. (traditional societies or communities)</p>
<p><strong>*Note:</strong><br>You might also see "a culture" used to describe an "attitude" e.g. The manager is trying to create a culture of success.</p>

<li>to go through it again (meaning: to do or experience something again)</li>
</ul>
<p>I also used some good words and phrases that would be suitable for both speaking and writing (i.e. this vocabulary is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> informal):</p>
<ul>
<li>procrastinating</li>
<li>producing a final draft</li>
<li>complete the final draft</li>
<li>the pressure of such a close deadline</li>
<li>manage the task in an efficient way</li>
<li>I limited myself to just ten research sources</li>
<li>summarise and synthesise</li>
<li>I was relieved and quite impressed with myself</li>
</ul>
<p>The vocabulary in the two lists above might not seem 'difficult', but it's the kind of natural "native-speaker" language that will impress the examiner. That's why I gave the answer a band 9.</p>

	<p>
				<p>In IELTS writing task 1, you might need to use verbs like increase, decrease, rise and fall. These verbs can be followed by the words 'to' and 'by', but what's the difference?</p>
<p>Let's use these figures:<br>- Company profit in 2005 = £20,000<br>- Company profit in 2010 = £25,000</p>
<p>Now compare these sentences:<br>- Company profit rose <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>to</strong></span> £25,000 in 2010.<br>- Company profit rose <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>by</strong></span> £5,000 between 2005 and 2010.</p>
<p>It's easy: 'to' is used before the new figure, and 'by' is used to show the change. It's the same when you are talking about a fall.</p>

	<p>
				<p>A student wrote to me with a useful question:</p>
<p><em>"My IELTS teacher told us not to mention complex subjects and show off knowledge in the speaking test. I tend to talk about my major using big words and terms to expand my answers. Would this be seen as "showing off knowledge"? And what do you think about this advice?"</em></p>
<p>To answer this question, let's compare two answers to the question "how often do you eat chocolate?":</p>
<p><strong>Answer 1:</strong><br>I probably eat something that contains chocolate, like a chocolate bar or a cake, every couple of days.</p>
<p><strong>Answer 2:</strong><br>I try to keep my chocolate intake to a minimum because it is relatively high in calories, and because sugary foods can lead to insulin resistance.</p>
<p>The second answer might look more difficult and impressive, but it actually seems inappropriate and unnatural. I much prefer the first answer. So, I think this is what the teacher meant when he/she advised students not to "show off their knowledge", and I agree with this advice.</p>

				<p>Here's my full answer to the pie chart question that we've been looking at recently.</p>
<p><em><strong>The chart below shows the results of a survey of people who visited four types of tourist attraction in Britain in the year 1999.<br><span style="color: #ffffff;">...</span></strong></em></p>

<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">...</span><br>The pie chart compares figures for visitors to four categories of tourist attraction and to five different theme parks in Britain in 1999.</p>
<p>It is clear that theme parks and museums / galleries were the two most popular types of tourist attraction in that year. Blackpool Pleasure Beach received by far the highest proportion of visitors in the theme park sector.</p>
<p>Looking at the information in more detail, we can see that 38% of the surveyed visitors went to a theme park, and 37% of them went to a museum or gallery. By contrast, historic houses and monuments were visited by only 16% of the sample, while wildlife parks and zoos were the least popular of the four types of tourist attraction, with only 9% of visitors.</p>
<p>In the theme park sector, almost half of the people surveyed (47%) had been to Blackpool Pleasure Beach. Alton Towers was the second most popular amusement park, with 17% of the sample, followed by Pleasureland in Southport, with 16%. Finally, Chessington World of Adventures and Legoland Windsor had each welcomed 10% of the surveyed visitors.</p>

				<p>If you're unsure about a bit of grammar, see what happens when you look at it in a much easier sentence. I'll demonstrate this with an example.</p>
<p><strong>A student asked me this question:</strong></p>
<p>Should we write "Companies A and B <span style="text-decoration: underline;">saw</span> waste output f<span style="text-decoration: underline;">a</span>ll" or "Companies A and B <span style="text-decoration: underline;">saw</span> waste output f<span style="text-decoration: underline;">e</span>ll"?</p>

<p>Hopefully the easy example above makes the grammar point much clearer.

<ol>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Exam techniques</span>:</strong> My aim on this blog is to show you how to approach the IELTS test. If you have <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2015/10/ielts-advice-the-first-thing-that-i-say.html">'a method for everything'</a>, you'll be well-prepared and confident.</li>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">English</span>:</strong> Of course, exam techniques won't help you to get a high score if your English is only at beginner or intermediate level. You'll also need to learn more English words and phrases, and you'll need to do lots of practice.</li>
</ol>

	<p>
				<p>Last week I showed you the chart below.</p>
<p><em><strong>The chart below shows the proportions of adults in Canada who own one car, two cars, more than two cars, or who do not own a car.</strong></em></p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c01b7c8bf612a970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="6a0120a5bb05d8970c01b7c8bca864970b-450wi" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c01b7c8bf612a970b img-responsive" src="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c01b7c8bf612a970b-450wi" style="width: 450px;" title="6a0120a5bb05d8970c01b7c8bca864970b-450wi"></a></p>
<p>As several people commented below last week's lesson, we can describe a pie chart even if the numbers are not shown. Here are some example sentences:</p>
<ul>
<li>Just over half of all adults in Canada own one car.</li>
<li>Roughly 50% of Canadian adults own one car, while approximately 25% of adults in Canada own two cars.</li>
<li>Less than a quarter of Canadians do not own a car.</li>
<li>Only a very small percentage (under 5%) of Canadian adults own more than two cars.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember: the full pie is always 100%, so it's easy for us to guess approximate proportions.</p>

	<p>
				<p>A student asked me: Can I use the words <em>pros and cons, leaps and bounds, merits and demerits</em>?</p>
<p><strong>Here's my simple answer:</strong></p>
<p>No. I don't recommend using any of those words in your IELTS test. I never use them, so why would you use them? By the way, if you want to check whether I use a word, <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2016/07/ielts-advice-search-this-website.html">click here</a> and follow the advice about how to search my website.</p>
<p><strong>Here's a longer answer:</strong></p>
<p>Why are you asking about those words? If you are studying vocabulary, you should be focusing on <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2011/12/ielts-vocabulary-topic-specific-vocabulary.html">'topic-specific' vocabulary</a>, not 'generic' language (words and phrases that can be used in any essay). Linking words and other generic words or phrases might be necessary in terms of essay structure, but they don't help your vocabulary score. That's why, for linking and organisation, I prefer to use 'normal' vocabulary like firstly, secondly, finally, however, on the one hand, on the other hand, furthermore, advantages, disadvantages, benefits, positives etc. There is no need to find less common alternatives for these words and phrases.</p>
<p><strong>Finally, a quick explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>"pros and cons" is a bit too informal for IELTS writing.</li>
<li>"leaps and bounds" is an informal phrase that we use to talk about improvements e.g. "Since living in the UK, my English has come on in leaps and bounds" (meaning: my English has improved a lot). You might be able to use this in the speaking test, but don't use it in an essay.</li>
<li>"merits and demerits" is not a good alternative for "advantages and disadvantages". I've never used the word "demerits" in my life.</li>
</ul>

	<p>
				<p>Somebody asked me: What should I do if the question contains a pie chart without numbers on it? Well, let's look at a simple example.</p>
<p><em><strong>The chart below shows the proportions of adults in Canada who own one car, two cars, more than two cars, or who do not own a car.</strong></em></p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c01b7c8bca864970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Cars pie chart" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c01b7c8bca864970b img-responsive" src="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c01b7c8bca864970b-450wi" style="width: 450px;" title="Cars pie chart"></a></p>

				<p>In yesterday's lesson I explained how I use a thesaurus and a collocations dictionary to help me to gather vocabulary ideas. Did you find it strange that an English teacher (and native English speaker) would need to use these resources?</p>
<p>It's true that, as a native English speaker, if I brainstorm for long enough I can probably find all of the ideas that I need in my head. However, I can make the task so much easier and quicker by using a dictionary, thesaurus, collocations dictionary and the Internet.</p>

				<p>IELTS candidates often use good collocations or phrases, but they get them slightly wrong. This is what happened in the sentences in yesterday's lesson:</p>
<p>1) Use "be + achievement". You can't use "win + achievement"<br>Example: It was a great achievement. Don't say: I won a great achievement.</p>
<p>2) "my hard work (had) paid off"<br>Example: I was proud that all of my hard work had paid off.<br>The mistake in yesterday's lesson was to make this passive (had been paid off).</p>
<p>3) "I'll never forget" and "I never forget" have different meanings<br>- I'll never forget the day when I passed the exam. (a memorable event)<br>- I never forget my mother's birthday. (you remember every year)</p>
<p>4) "lose interest in something". Never write the plural "interests"<br>Example: I lost interest in the course.</p>
<p>5) With the word "difficulty / difficulties" you can use these verbs:<br>have, face, experience, encounter, run into, get into<br>You can't say "difficulties concurred".</p>
<p>6) "due to" is followed by a noun, not a subject + verb<br>Example: due to the fact that I had never...<br>Don't say: due to I had never...</p>

<p>The line graph compares three companies in terms of their waste output between the years 2000 and 2015.</p>
<p>It is clear that there were significant changes in the amounts of waste produced by all three companies shown on the graph. While companies A and B saw waste output fall over the 15-year period, the amount of waste produced by company C increased considerably.</p>
<p>In 2000, company A produced 12 tonnes of waste, while companies B and C produced around 8 tonnes and 4 tonnes of waste material respectively. Over the following 5 years, the waste output of companies B and C rose by around 2 tonnes, but the figure for company A fell by approximately 1 tonne.</p>
<p>From 2005 to 2015, company A cut waste production by roughly 3 tonnes, and company B reduced its waste by around 7 tonnes. By contrast, company C saw an increase in waste production of approximately 4 tonnes over the same 10-year period. By 2015, company C’s waste output had risen to 10 tonnes, while the respective amounts of waste from companies A and B had dropped to 8 tonnes and only 3 tonnes.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Let's look at the first two paragraphs of my sample answer for the question below.</p>
<p><strong><em>The graph below shows the amounts of waste produced by three companies over a period of 15 years.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>Introduction (paraphrase the question):</strong><br>The line graph compares three companies in terms of their waste output between the year 2000 and the year 2015.</p>
<p><strong>Overview (two main / general points):</strong><br>It is clear that there were significant changes in the amounts of waste produced by all three companies shown on the graph.

	<p>
				<p>Here are some main points that most people noticed about the graph in last week's <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2016/11/ielts-writing-task-1-more-overview-practice.html">lesson</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>There were significant changes in the amounts of waste produced by all three companies.</li>
<li>Waste produced by companies A and B decreased, but waste produced by company C increased.</li>
<li>Company A was the biggest waste producer at the beginning of the period, but C was the biggest producer by the end of the period.</li>
<li>Company A produced the largest amount of waste in total.</li>
</ul>
<p>I recommend choosing just <em><strong>two</strong></em> of these main points for a two-sentence overview paragraph. For example:</p>
<p><em>It is clear that there were significant changes in the amounts of waste produced by all three companies shown on the graph. While companies A and B saw waste output fall over the 15-year period, the amount of waste produced by company C increased considerably.</em></p>

	<p>
				<p><em>I've given the following advice several times before on this blog, but I think it's worth repeating in connection with <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2016/10/ielts-writing-task-1-did-you-notice-the-80.html">last week's lesson</a>.</em></p>
<p>A current examiner recently told me that the most common mistake in students' task 1 answers is that there is no overview. This was also true when I was an examiner.</p>
<p>So what makes a good overview? Here are a few tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>An overview is simply a summary of the main things you can see.</li>
<li>Because the overview is so important, I recommend putting it at the beginning of your report, just after the introduction sentence.</li>
<li>I write two overview sentences. A one-sentence overview isn't really enough.</li>
<li>Try not to include specific numbers in the overview. Save the specifics for later paragraphs.</li>
<li>Look at the 'big picture' e.g. the overall change from the first year to the last year (if years are shown on the chart), the differences between whole categories rather than single numbers, or the total number of stages in a process.</li>
</ul>
<p>Have another look at the overview paragraphs (paragraph 2) in the task 1 answers that I've written here on the site. Analyse them carefully, and practise writing your own overviews in the same way.</p>

	<p>
				<p>A student asked me recently which preposition to use with the word 'spending'. But there isn't an easy answer to this question. Here are a few possible phrases:</p>
<p>- spending <strong>on</strong> food<br>- spending <strong>by</strong> teenagers<br>- spending <strong>in</strong> the UK<br>- spending <strong>during</strong> the summer holiday<br>- spending <strong>throughout</strong> October<br>- spending <strong>in</strong> dollars<br>- spending <strong>via</strong> mobile phone apps</p>
<p>Correct use of prepositions is one of the most difficult aspects of learning English. However, instead of learning 'rules', I recommend that you simply copy the phrases that you read and hear. This is how native speakers learn to use prepositions.</p>

	<p>
				<p>In my experience, not many people are able to write a good overview / summary paragraph under exam conditions. They can see specific information, but they find it difficult to see the "big picture".</p>
<p>Let's try looking for the "big picture" in some data. We can then write a good overview or summary.</p>
<p><em><strong>Percentage of students able to speak languages other than English:</strong></em></p>
<p>30% - Spanish<br>15% - French<br>10% - German<br>15% - another language (not Spanish, French or German)<br>10% - two other languages<br>20% - no other language</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(adapted from Cambridge IELTS book 11)</span></p>
<p><strong>Writing your overview / summary paragraph:</strong></p>
<p>I'm sure you noticed the biggest number straight away (30% - Spanish), and we could certainly mention this in our overview. Many people then look for the smallest number, but I wouldn't do that in this case. I think there is something better that we can mention: the 80% of students who are able to speak at least one foreign language. Did you notice the 80%?</p>
<p><strong>Here's my 2-sentence overview / summary:</strong></p>
<p>It is noticeable that the vast majority of students are able to speak at least one foreign language, as well as English. We can also see that Spanish is the most widely spoken second language among the surveyed group of students.</p>
<p><strong>PS.</strong> I don't usually include numbers in my summary, so I wrote 'vast majority' instead of 80%, and 'most widely spoken second language' instead of 30%. We can add the figures in our "details" paragraphs.</p>

	<p>
				<p>In writing task 1, there will probably be one or two key words or phrases that you find yourself repeating in almost every sentence. For example, last week's <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2016/09/ielts-writing-task-1-separate-line-graphs-answer.html">graphs</a> were about <em><strong>spending</strong></em> on sport and <em><strong>participation</strong></em> in sport, so it was necessary to mention these two ideas several times in the answer.</p>
<p><strong>Add variety where you can</strong><br>In my answer, I did try to add some variety where I felt that an alternative word or phrase worked well. For example, instead of "participation in" I also wrote:</p>
<p>- took part in<br>- taking part<br>- played<br>- were enrolled in<br>- practised<br>- doing</p>
<p><strong>But repetition can also be positive</strong><br>I wasn't too worried about repeating the key ideas (spending and participation) a few times. I wrote "parents spent" three times and I used the word "participation" four times. It can help the coherence of your writing if a key word or phrase is repeated, because this helps the reader to make connections between ideas in different sentences. Too much variety can confuse the reader. For example, it will seem very strange if you use 10 different synonyms for a word like "spending".</p>
<p>Remember: variety is good, but repetition is also normal.</p>

<p><em><strong>Here's my full answer:</strong></em></p>
<p>The line graphs show the average monthly amount that parents in Britain spent on their children’s sporting activities and the number of British children who took part in three different sports from 2008 to 2014.</p>
<p>It is clear that parents spent more money each year on their children’s participation in sports over the six-year period. In terms of the number of children taking part, football was significantly more popular than athletics and swimming.</p>
<p>In 2008, British parents spent an average of around £20 per month on their children’s sporting activities. Parents’ spending on children’s sports increased gradually over the following six years, and by 2014 the average monthly amount had risen to just over £30.</p>
<p>Looking at participation numbers, in 2008 approximately 8 million British children played football, while only 2 million children were enrolled in swimming clubs and less than 1 million practised athletics. The figures for football participation remained relatively stable over the following 6 years. By contrast, participation in swimming almost doubled, to nearly 4 million children, and there was a near fivefold increase in the number of children doing athletics.</p>

				<p>Someone asked me about the following phrase, which describes a band 9 task response in writing task 2:</p>
<p><em>"presents a fully developed position with relevant, fully extended and well supported ideas"</em></p>
<p>Is it really possible to "fully extend and support" your ideas in such a short essay? Probably not. If you had time to write 1000 words, I'm sure you could extend and support your ideas more fully.</p>
<p>However, we shouldn't "overthink" this problem. Examiners know that it's impossible to write a truly perfect, fully developed answer in just 250 words. They understand the limitations of the task, and (hopefully!) they use their common sense. Instead of worrying about the precise meaning of the band descriptions, it's best to simply focus on answering the question as well as you can.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Occasionally I like to use this blog to share my thoughts about how to achieve goals. Here's a summary of what I believe are the keys to success in IELTS, or in any other endeavour:</p>
<p><strong>1) The best information</strong><br>If you want to achieve something, you first need to find the best source of information and guidance that you can.</p>
<p><strong>2) Persistent work</strong><br>Of course, you'll need to use the information that you have and take action. You'll need to do the regular practice that leads to improvement.</p>
<p><strong>3) Positive attitude</strong> (or <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2014/11/ielts-reading-multiple-choice.html">growth mindset</a>)<br>If you have the right guidance and you're working hard, you need to be positive and patient. Try not to waste time worrying; instead, trust the process and know that you will improve gradually. Don't expect fast or easy results.</p>
<p><strong>4) Measure your progress</strong><br>Finally, you need to find a way to analyse the work that you produce. This will allow you to learn from your mistakes and make any necessary changes to your approach. Also, tracking your progress will give you confidence that you are moving towards your goal.</p>

<p><em><strong>The first chart below gives information about the money spent by British parents on their children’s sports between 2008 and 2014. The second chart shows the number of children who participated in three sports in Britain over the same time period.</strong></em></p>

<p><strong>Introduction and overview:</strong></p>
<p>The line graphs show the average monthly amount that parents in Britain spent on their children’s sporting activities and the number of British children who took part in three different sports from 2008 to 2014.</p>
<p>It is clear that parents spent more money each year on their children’s participation in sports over the 6-year period. In terms of the number of children taking part, football was significantly more popular than athletics and swimming.</p>
<p><strong>Remember:</strong><br>You just need one sentence for the introduction, and you can write it by paraphrasing the question statement (rewrite it in your own words). Try to write two sentences for your overview paragraph; in this case we can describe one main feature of each graph.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here's a list of the good vocabulary from Friday's speaking lesson:</p>
<ul>
<li>working in a previous job</li>
<li>catch an early flight</li>
<li>a senior member of our department</li>
<li>had volunteered to</li>
<li>waiting to be picked up</li>
<li>look out for his car</li>
<li>I overslept</li>
<li>I had set my alarm</li>
<li>I must have turned it off</li>
<li>I sprang out of bed</li>
<li>got dressed in record time</li>
<li>I splashed some water on my face</li>
<li>put my shoes on without properly tying the laces</li>
<li>I was filled with a sense of panic</li>
<li>walked towards the awaiting car</li>
<li>I felt so embarrassed</li>
<li>it was obvious that I hadn’t been ready on time</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em><br>These words and phrases might not seem 'difficult' or 'academic'. However, examiners don't often meet candidates who use this kind of natural, native-speaker language.</p>
<p>In particular, phrases like "I sprang out of bed", "I got dressed in record time" and "I splashed some water on my face" would certainly surprise an examiner.</p>

	<p>
				<p>I used several phrasal verbs (e.g. pick up, look out for, turn off, carry on) in my description in yesterday's lesson.</p>
<p>These verbs look easy, but they are good examples of the kind of natural, idiomatic language that native speakers use. The tricky thing about phrasal verbs is that you have to learn what each one means; you can't understand them by translating the individual words.</p>
<p>For example, I used "pick up" to mean "collect" (I was waiting for my colleague to collect me), but "pick up" can also mean improve, learn quickly, or receive. Have a look at <a href="https://www.usingenglish.com/reference/phrasal-verbs/pick+up.html">this page</a> on a grammar website. Can you see why phrasal verbs might impress the examiner if you use them correctly?</p>

	<p>
				<p>Recently I've heard from quite a few people whose writing scores were raised from 6.5 to band 7 after they asked for a re-mark. This suggests that some examiners are a bit too cautious when marking, especially at the higher levels.</p>
<p>There are no guarantees when you ask for a re-mark. However, if you think you did well in the <em><strong>writing</strong></em> test, if you got higher scores in the other three parts, and if you missed your target by only half a band, it might be worth a try.</p>

	<p>
				<p>A student called Sebastian asked me the following useful question:</p>
<p><em>In writing task 2, what if I choose a strong opinion answer (e.g. completely agree) but I only have one idea? In other words, I only have an idea for one main-body paragraph, so what can I write in the second body paragraph?</em></p>
<p>Here are my tips to address Sebastian's question:</p>
<ol>
<li>You could solve this problem during your planning time, before you start writing. If you realise that you only have one idea, you still have time to change to a 'balanced' opinion answer.</li>
<li>Alternatively, you could use the <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2010/10/ielts-writing-task-2-tourism.html">'perspectives'</a> approach to planning. This might help you to divide your main idea into two parts (e.g. the same idea from an individual perspective and from a social or economic perspective).</li>
<li>Another method that I use is to support my opinion in paragraph 2, and then refute the opposite opinion in paragraph 3. This is the essay structure that I suggested in Wednesday's <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2016/08/ielts-writing-task-2-introduction-and-plan.html">lesson</a>.

	<p>
				<p>Here's my full answer for the pie charts task below.</p>
<p><em><strong>The charts below show the results of a questionnaire that asked visitors to the Parkway Hotel how they rated the hotel's customer service. The same questionnaire was given to 100 guests in the years 2005 and 2010.</strong></em></p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c01b7c882e02f970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Pie charts" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c01b7c882e02f970b img-responsive" src="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c01b7c882e02f970b-500wi" title="Pie charts"></a></p>
<p>The pie charts compare visitors’ responses to a survey about customer service at the Parkway Hotel in 2005 and in 2010.</p>
<p>It is clear that overall customer satisfaction increased considerably from 2005 to 2010. While most hotel guests rated customer service as satisfactory or poor in 2005, a clear majority described the hotel’s service as good or excellent in 2010.</p>
<p>Looking at the positive responses first, in 2005 only 5% of the hotel’s visitors rated its customer service as excellent, but this figure rose to 28% in 2010. Furthermore, while only 14% of guests described customer service in the hotel as good in 2005, almost three times as many people gave this rating five years later.</p>
<p>With regard to negative feedback, the proportion of guests who considered the hotel’s customer service to be poor fell from 21% in 2005 to only 12% in 2010. Similarly, the proportion of people who thought customer service was very poor dropped from 15% to only 4% over the 5-year period. Finally, a fall in the number of ‘satisfactory’ ratings in 2010 reflects the fact that more people gave positive responses to the survey in that year.</p>

				<p>People are often surprised when I tell them to stop thinking about 'academic' language, complex grammar or 'difficult' words. In <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2016/05/ielts-writing-task-2-ignore-the-word-academic.html">this lesson</a>, for example, I suggest that IELTS writing task 2 is more like a high school essay than a university assignment.</p>
<p>Here's some feedback from a student in relation to this advice:</p>
<p><em>Hi Simon,</em></p>
<p><em>I was initially very sceptical of your "high school" writing approach. I believed in a complicated, "academic" style writing with flashy words and complex sentences. Well, I was wrong.</em></p>
<p><em>With that mindset, on the IELTS test day I confidently penned a monstrous 400-word essay with multiple metaphors, symbolism, lengthy sentences, and analyses of complex real-world examples. I ended up getting a band 7 for writing (L9, R9, S8.5).</em></p>
<p><em>I was very surprised. What I came to understand is that the IELTS encourages clear, concise and coherent writing more than anything else. It really is a high school writing task. If I ever take the IELTS test again, I will make absolutely sure to follow the simple and effective strategy that you advocate.</em></p>

				<p>Have a look at my full answer for the question below.</p>
<p><em><strong>The pie charts below compare water usage in San Diego, California and the rest of the world.</strong></em><br><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #ffffff;">mm</span></p>

<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #ffffff;">mm</span><br>The pie charts give information about the water used for residential, industrial and agricultural purposes in San Diego County, California, and the world as a whole.</p>
<p>It is noticeable that more water is consumed by homes than by industry or agriculture in the two American regions. By contrast, agriculture accounts for the vast majority of water used worldwide.</p>
<p>In San Diego County and California State, residential water consumption accounts for 60% and 39% of total water usage. By contrast, a mere 8% of the water used globally goes to homes. The opposite trend can be seen when we look at water consumption for agriculture. This accounts for a massive 69% of global water use, but only 17% and 28% of water usage in San Diego and California respectively.</p>
<p>Such dramatic differences are not seen when we compare the figures for industrial water use. The same proportion of water (23%) is used by industry in San Diego and worldwide, while the figure for California is 10% higher, at 33%.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Instead of correcting every grammar mistake, an easier way to improve the introduction paragraph in yesterday's lesson would be to simplify it. To simplify something, we need to focus on the <em><strong>message</strong></em> that we are trying to communicate; how can we deliver that message in the clearest, simplest way?</p>
<p>For example, here's a simplified version of the introduction:</p>
<p><em>Many people are confident that this century will be a positive one. I share this optimism, and there are several positive changes that I hope to see over the coming years.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>The introduction is the most general part of the report; it tells the reader what the chart is about.</li>
<li>Then I write a short paragraph about the main / general points.</li>
<li>Finally, I write 2 paragraphs describing specific facts or figures.</li>
<li>I don't write a conclusion because I have already summarised the information in paragraph 2.</li>
</ul>

	<p>
				<p>Last week I did some IELTS teacher training at Liverpool University. Afterwards, I asked the teachers what they found most useful about the session, and three things stood out:</p>
<ol>
<li>They liked my advice on essay planning for writing task 2. In particular, they thought that numbering the ideas in the plan was really useful. Watch <a href="http://subscriptions.viddler.com/SimonCorcoran/fkvcqe">this video</a> to see an example.</li>
<li>They had a clearer understanding of the differences between IELTS writing and university academic writing e.g. using <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2012/01/ielts-writing-task-2-using-the-word-i.html">the word "I"</a>.</li>
<li>They liked the idea that <em><strong>it's easier to get faster than it is to get better</strong></em>. Don't worry if it takes you <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2011/08/ielts-advice-the-four-hour-essay.html">four hours</a> to write a band 7 essay; the important thing is that you're achieving that score. Your only task now is to gradually speed up.</li>
</ol>

<p>In the speaking test, listen carefully to the question and answer it as if you were speaking to a friend. Try to speak without thinking too much; forget the grammar and just have a normal conversation.</p>
<p>In the writing test, take some time to understand each question and plan your answer. Check the question every time you write a new idea; make sure that everything you write is <em><strong>relevant</strong></em>. If part of your answer is not related to the topic you will lose marks, even if your grammar is perfect.</p>

				<p>I often advise students to try to enjoy studying English and preparing for the IELTS test.</p>
<p>However, sometimes the boring things are the most useful: rewriting an essay to improve it, looking up words in a dictionary, learning correct spellings by heart. If you're not doing any boring work, maybe you're not working hard enough!</p>

				<p>Did you notice the following phrase in my conclusion in Wednesday's <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2016/04/ielts-writing-task-2-short-fast-conclusions.html">lesson</a>?</p>
<p><em>"companies should <span style="text-decoration: underline;">place</span> as much <span style="text-decoration: underline;">importance</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">on</span> their social responsibilities"</em></p>
<p>Notice the "verb + noun" collocation that I used: <em><strong>place importance on</strong></em></p>
<p>Did you know that we can say "place importance on something"? Have you ever used this collocation / phrase yourself?</p>
<p>You might think that you know the word "importance", but I would be surprised if you knew all of the common collocations on <a href="http://oxforddictionary.so8848.com/search?word=importance">this webpage</a>.

				<p>A few things to remember when the graph or chart shows countries:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the question doesn't name the countries (e.g. "in three countries"), you could name them in your introduction (e.g. "in Britain, France and Germany"). You could even write "in three countries, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">namely</span> Britain, France and Germany".</li>
<li>Don't forget the word "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span>" when writing about "the USA" and "the UK".</li>
<li>Always <span style="text-decoration: underline;">compare</span> the countries; never describe the figures for each country in separate paragraphs.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, try to vary the way you write about countries. For example:</p>
<ul>

	<p>
				<p>In yesterday's lesson I asked why teachers often give students the wrong advice about IELTS writing. This can happen even with teachers who are generally very good at teaching English.</p>
<p>In my experience, the reason is simple:</p>
<p>Many teachers have been trained to teach<em><strong> academic writing for university</strong></em>, but they haven't had any specific <em><strong>IELTS training</strong></em>. IELTS writing follows a few different rules compared to university writing, and teachers aren't always aware of the differences. Maybe we need a list of these differences; can you think of any?</p>

	<p>
				<p>Instead of looking for a grammatical explanation for the use of a word or phrase, it's often better to search for real examples of usage.</p>
<p>Take the following question, for example. A student asked me:</p>
<p><em>Is there a difference between "in terms of" and "with regard to"? When and how should we use these phrases?</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Task:</strong></em><br>Can you find 3 examples of each of the two phrases in the student's question above? Use a search engine, such as Google, and choose examples that come from reliable sources (e.g. newspaper articles). Does this help you to see how and when the two phrases are used?

	<p>
				<p>Last week I asked you to look for problems in this introduction:</p>
<p>The bar graphs give information and compare between the kinds of jobs opted by UK's undergraduate and postgraduate students who did not go for a full time job after completing their degrees in 2008.</p>
<p>Here are some things that you might have noticed:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>give information and compare between</strong></em>: We don't need two verbs at the beginning of the introduction, and "between" doesn't work with either of them. Either write "give information about" or "compare" (without the word "between").</li>
<li><em><strong>kinds of jobs</strong></em>: The charts show activities like "further study", so we can't write about "jobs" here.</li>
<li><em><strong>opted by</strong></em>: We say "opt for" in English, so we would need to write "opted for by" in this case, which seems awkward to me. It would be easier to use "chosen by". However, as one of the categories on the chart is "unemployment", maybe it isn't accurate to write about this as a choice.</li>
<li><em><strong>UK's</strong></em>: using a possessive with the country seems strange in this situation. Instead, we can use "UK" as an adjective (e.g. UK graduates), or simply write "in the UK".</li>
<li><em><strong>go for a job</strong></em> seems a bit informal in this situation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's a simplified and corrected version of the introduction:</p>
<p>The bar charts give information about the career paths of UK undergraduate and postgraduate students who were not in full-time employment after completing their degrees in 2008.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Students often don't notice when a teacher corrects their mistakes.</p>
<p>Look at this example of a conversation between a student and a teacher:</p>
<p>Student: <em>I gave the IELTS test five times.</em><br>Teacher: <em>Oh, you've taken the test five times?</em><br>Student: <em>Yes, the last time I gave it was two weeks ago.</em></p>
<p>The student doesn't notice that the teacher is correcting a mistake. In English we <em><strong>don't</strong></em> say "give a test" (unless you are the examiner giving the test to the students), we say "<em><strong>take</strong></em> a test".</p>
<p>When a teacher repeats something that you said in a different way, it's possible that you made a mistake. Listen carefully, and try to notice mistakes and corrections. If you're not sure, ask the teacher whether you made a mistake.</p>

<p><em><strong>The chart below shows the amount of time that 10 to 15-year-olds spend chatting on the Internet and playing on games consoles on an average school day in the UK.</strong></em></p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c01b8d1b2dea7970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="6a0120a5bb05d8970c01bb08c994f0970d-500wi" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c01b8d1b2dea7970c img-responsive" src="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c01b8d1b2dea7970c-500wi" title="6a0120a5bb05d8970c01bb08c994f0970d-500wi"></a></p>
<p>Boys aged between 10 and 15 clearly favour playing on games consoles over chatting online. According to the chart, while 85% of boys play computer games every day, only 55% chat online daily. Furthermore, the majority of boys play on their consoles for more than one hour each day, and 10% do this activity for four hours or more.</p>
<p>By contrast, girls prefer chatting online. Close to 70% of 10 to 15-year-old girls engage in online conversation each day, compared to about 50% of this cohort who play computer games. Of the girls who do play on consoles, most of them play for less than an hour, whereas most girls who chat online do so for more than one hour, and nearly 10% chat for four hours or more.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em><br>I decided to write about boys in one paragraph and girls in the other. However, it would also be fine to write paragraphs about chatting on the Internet and playing on consoles.</p>

	<p>
				<p>You should <em><strong>not</strong></em> write a conclusion for IELTS writing task 1. You should write an "overview" of the information.</p>
<p><em><strong>But why shouldn't you write a conclusion? What's the difference between a conclusion and an overview?</strong></em></p>
<p>First, a conclusion is a final judgement, decision or opinion. This is perfect for the task 2 essay, but task 1 asks you to write a description without analysis or opinions. On the other hand, an "overview" is a simple description of the main points. It is a summary of the information shown on the graph or chart.</p>
<p>Second, a conclusion should be at the end of a piece of writing. An overview or general summary could go either at the end or near the beginning. Personally, I think it's a good idea to describe the main features of the graph or chart near the beginning of your report.</p>
<p><em><strong>So, my suggested structure for task 1 looks like this:</strong></em></p>
<ol>
<li>Introduction: what does the chart show?</li>
<li>Overview / summary: what are the most noticeable features?</li>
<li>Specific details: try to write 2 paragraphs.</li>

	<p>
				<p>In the comments below <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2016/02/ielts-writing-task-2-disagree-essay-with-both-sides.html">Wednesday's lesson</a>, a few people said that they didn't see any "advanced" vocabulary* in my essay. But examiners are not looking for "advanced" vocabulary; they are looking for "less common" vocabulary.</p>
<p>"Less common" vocabulary means words and phrases that most students wouldn't think to use in their essays. For example, in the first line of my essay, I used the verb "to rival". You might know the noun "rival", but have you ever used it as a verb? This is not an "advanced" word, but it is certainly <em><strong>less commonly used</strong></em> by IELTS candidates, and the examiner would be impressed to see it used in this way.</p>
<p>Here are the "less common" phrases from my essay:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Internet is beginning to rival newspapers</li>
<li>the traditional press</li>
<li>vital source of information</li>
<li>the Internet age</li>
<li>traditional means of communicating</li>
<li>rural areas</li>
<li>the ability or opportunity to get online</li>
<li>trusted as reliable sources</li>
<li>employ professional journalists and editors</li>
<li>news in real time</li>
<li>gadgets and mobile devices</li>
<li>contribute with our own updates on social media</li>
<li>an explosion in the use of platforms</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong><br>Although you probably <em><strong>understand</strong></em> the phrases above, most candidates would not <em><strong>use</strong></em> them in their essays.</p>
<p>*I never use the terms "advanced vocabulary" or "difficult vocabulary". Anyone can find a "big" word in the dictionary and translate it. The difficult skill is to use words together in&nbsp;<a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2013/03/ielts-vocabulary-band-7-or-higher.html">collocations</a> and phrases.</p>

	<p>
				<p>People often ask me about inventing statistics in their task 2 essays. For example, if the question is about crime, they might invent something like this:</p>
<p><em>"According to a recent report from Oxford University, around 60% of prisoners reoffend after being released."</em></p>
<p>Although this looks like a good 'academic-style' sentence, I still wouldn't recommend writing it. Here are two reasons why:</p>
<ol>
<li>As you don't have access to research in your exam, statistics like this always seem 'fake' to the examiner.</li>
<li>Statistics aren't really appropriate for the style of writing that examiners expect. They are expecting an opinion-based essay, not a research-based assignment.</li>
</ol>
<p>Rather than relying on invented statistics, focus on expressing your own views.</p>

				<p><em><strong>Here's my full answer for the 'phone calls' bar chart in <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2016/01/ielts-writing-task-1-phone-calls-bar-chart.html">this lesson</a>:</strong></em></p>
<p>The bar chart compares the amount of time spent by people in the UK on three different types of phone call between 1995 and 2002.</p>
<p>It is clear that calls made via local, fixed lines were the most popular type, in terms of overall usage, throughout the period shown. The lowest figures on the chart are for mobile calls, but this category also saw the most dramatic increase in user minutes.</p>
<p>In 1995, people in the UK used fixed lines for a total of just over 70 billion minutes for local calls, and about half of that amount of time for national or international calls. By contrast, mobile phones were only used for around 4 billion minutes. Over the following four years, the figures for all three types of phone call increased steadily.</p>
<p>By 1999, the amount of time spent on local calls using landlines had reached a peak at 90 billion minutes. Subsequently, the figure for this category fell, but the rise in the other two types of phone call continued. In 2002, the number of minutes of national / international landline calls passed 60 billion, while the figure for mobiles rose to around 45 billion minutes.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Some students worry about being 'original'. They worry that too many other candidates might use the same ideas, vocabulary or linking words as them. For example, several people have asked me whether the examiner will notice if they use the vocabulary from my blog lessons or ebook. Others worry that simple linking words like "firstly, secondly, finally" are too common or even too 'old'.</p>
<p>So, is it true that we should worry about these things? Do candidates need to use 'new', original language in their tests?</p>
<p>The answer is no! IELTS is not testing your originality; it's testing your ability to use the English language in a normal, natural way. Don't worry about any of the things mentioned above!</p>

				<p>Several people have asked me for help with the following question, from Cambridge IELTS book 9:</p>
<p><em><strong>The chart below shows the total number of minutes (in billions) of telephone calls in the UK, divided into three categories, from 1995-2002.</strong></em></p>

<li><strong>Overview:</strong> point out which category was highest in each year, which was lowest, and which saw the biggest changes.</li>
<li><strong>Details:</strong> compare the 3 categories in 1995, then say what happened up until 1999.</li>
<li><strong>Details:</strong> notice what happened to local calls from 1999 onwards, and contrast this with the other 2 categories. Finish with a comparison of the figures in 2002.</li>

<p>Personally, I think it's normal and even helpful to feel nervous before an exam. The feeling that I think you should aim for is a healthy mix of nervousness and determination. The determination comes from knowing that you are well prepared for the challenge; when you feel like this, the nerves usually disappear as soon as you start the first part of the exam.</p>

<p>The two charts give information about single-occupant households in England in the year 2011. The bar chart compares figures for occupants' age and gender, and the pie chart shows data about the number of bedrooms in these homes.</p>
<p>Overall, females made up a higher proportion of people living alone than males, and this difference is particularly noticeable in the older age categories. We can also see that the most common number of bedrooms in a single-occupant home was two.</p>
<p>A significant majority of the people aged 65 or over who were living alone in England in 2011 were female. Women made up around 72% of single occupants aged 75 to 84, and 76% of those aged 85 or over. By contrast, among younger adults the figures for males were higher. For example, in the 35-49 age category, men accounted for nearly 65% of people living alone.</p>
<p>In the same year, 35.4% of one-person households in England had two bedrooms, while one-bedroom and three-bedroom homes accounted for 28% and 29.8% of the total. Under 7% of single-occupant homes had four or more bedrooms.</p>
<p>(189 words, band 9)</p>
<p><em><strong>Tip:</strong></em><br>Notice that I was forced to leave out some of the information from the bar chart. This is normal when you only have 20 minutes; examiners expect you to select some key figures, not to try to include everything.</p>

<li>more useful than <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a</span> competitive <span style="text-decoration: underline;">determination</span> to win</li>
</ol>
<p>The student asked why I used the article "a" in the second phrase. Isn't "determination" an uncountable noun? The answer is, not always.</p>
<p>Sometimes we use "determination" as a countable noun. In the second sentence above, I'm writing about one specific type of determination: the determination to win. In this case it's correct to write "a determination".</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em><br>People often ask me to make a lesson that explains how to use articles. The problem is that article use doesn't follow a set of simple 'rules'. I think it's best to learn gradually by reading lots of English and by <em><strong>noticing</strong></em> things like the example above.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Most people who read this blog have the overall aim of passing the IELTS test with a certain score. But what specific actions are you going to take to achieve this overall aim? For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write one essay every week, get it checked by a teacher, and rewrite it.</li>
<li>Do a full reading test once a week, check the answers, analyse my mistakes, and make a keyword table.</li>
<li>Read this blog every day and follow Simon's advice :)</li>
</ul>
<p>By the way, my own overall aim for this year is to finish my video course and my teacher training course. My small, short-term goal (my first specific action) is to produce the first video lesson for the speaking test.</p>

	<p>
				<p>A New Year's resolution is an intention or objective for the coming year. The problem is that most people (including me!) break their resolutions - apparently 35% of New Year's resolutions are broken by the end of January.</p>
<p>If you're making a New Year’s resolution related to IELTS, here’s an idea:</p>
<p>We know that the overall aim is to pass the IELTS test, but the best resolutions are <strong><em>small</em></strong> and <strong><em>achievable</em></strong>. It’s disheartening to break a promise that you made to yourself, so start with something very easy. Why not make a <strong><em>short-term</em></strong> resolution for January only? When you've achieved that aim, you can set another one for February. Each aim can become gradually more difficult as you gain confidence.</p>
<p>Do you have a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">small</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">short-term</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">achievable</span> objective for January?

				<p>If the question shows two <em><strong>different</strong></em> charts, we can summarise each one <em><strong>separately</strong></em>. After the introduction, we can write a 2-sentence 'overview' of the information, with one sentence to summarise each chart.</p>

<p><strong>Overview / summary paragraph:</strong></p>
<p>Overall, females made up a higher proportion of people living alone than males, and this difference is particularly noticeable in the older age categories. We can also see that the most common number of bedrooms in a single-occupant home was two.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Following on from yesterday's lesson, here are some key points to remember.</p>
<p><strong>1) Superlatives can be used after possessive forms, without "the":</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>My highest IELTS score was...</li>
<li>His fastest running time was...</li>
<li>Britain's oldest person is...</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2) Miss "the" if the noun is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">before</span> (not after) the superlative:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The UK had <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">highest</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">revenue</span> from bananas. (noun after, use "the")</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Revenue</span> from bananas was <span style="text-decoration: underline;">highest</span> in the UK. (noun before, no "the")</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3) Miss "the" when the meaning is "at its..." or "at their...":</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Revenue from bananas was (at its) highest in the UK.</li>
<li>Temperatures are (at their) warmest in the south of the country.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Task:</strong><br>Here's a puzzle for you. The sentence below is correct, but it seems to break the 'rule' in point 2 above. Can you explain why I wrote "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> oldest" even though there is no noun after the superlative?</p>
<p><em>The London underground is the oldest.</em></p>

	<p>
				<p>In <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2011/12/ielts-grammar-highest-or-the-highest.html">this lesson</a> I gave a grammatical explanation of when to write "highest" without the word "the" before it. For example:</p>
<p>- The UK had <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>the</strong></em> highest rate</span> of unemployment. (the highest + noun)<br>- The unemployment <span style="text-decoration: underline;">rate was highest</span> in the UK. (noun before 'highest', no 'the')</p>
<p>However, there might be an easier way to remember when to miss the word "the".&nbsp; We miss the word "the" when "highest" means "at its highest" or "at their highest" e.g. The unemployment rate was<em><strong> at its highest</strong></em> in the UK.</p>
<p>Let's try this with a few more examples:</p>
<p>1. Rainfall is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">highest</span> in October. (Rainfall is <em><strong>at its highest</strong></em> in October)<br>2. Temperatures are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">warmest</span> in the south of the country. (at their warmest)<br>3. Traffic is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">slowest</span> between 7 and 9am. (at its slowest)</p>
<p>In the above examples, don't put the word "the" before the superlative adjectives.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here's a question that a student wrote in the "comments" below one of my lessons this week:</p>
<p><em>Dear Simon,</em></p>
<p><em>I'm reading your model essays and find them easy to follow and understand. They are totally different from what I'm being trained to write in my IELTS class. We are advised to include linking words, adverbs and descriptive clauses in almost every sentence, while your sentences are much shorter and cleaner. Please give me your opinion about this difference.</em></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Note: I've corrected a few small mistakes that the student made)</span></p>
<p>For me, this is an important question because it highlights one of the main reasons why I started writing this blog: I disagree with the way that many teachers, books and websites teach IELTS, and I wanted to suggest a different approach. Examiners are pleasantly surprised when they see essays that are 'clean' and easy to follow, and you might find that your scores improve as you start to focus on <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2015/09/ielts-writing-task-2-focus-on-real-content.html">real content</a> instead of linking words and memorised phrases.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Many people ask me how they can improve their IELTS scores. In my experience, improvements tend to happen in the following way:</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c017c36ea12ad970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Screen Shot 2013-02-16 at 17.32.35" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c017c36ea12ad970b" src="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c017c36ea12ad970b-800wi" title="Screen Shot 2013-02-16 at 17.32.35"></a></p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> </em>The numbers on the graph refer to stages of improvement, not scores.</p>
<p>Here's my explanation of the four stages of improvement:</p>
<ol>
<li>When a student first starts taking IELTS lessons, they learn useful exam techniques and they do some practice tests. They often improve quite quickly at this stage.</li>
<li>However, there is a limit to the improvements that you can make with exam techniques alone. Stage 2 represents the frustrating period during which your score stays the same.</li>
<li>The only way to reach point 3 is by working hard to improve your English. There are no secrets, shortcuts or special techniques; learning a second language takes time and practice.</li>
<li>In the end, students who persist do tend to get the scores they need! (I'm afraid nobody can tell you how long this will take).</li>

				<p>Students often make simple mistakes that could be avoided. In exam conditions this is understandable, but there is no excuse for making careless mistakes in your homework!</p>

	<p>
				<p><strong>Here's my full answer for the table question that you can see <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2015/10/ielts-writing-task-1-table.html" target="_self" title="">here</a>:</strong></p>
<p>The tables show the amount of money spent on Fairtrade coffee and bananas in two separate years in the UK, Switzerland, Denmark, Belgium and Sweden.</p>
<p>It is clear that sales of Fairtrade coffee rose in all five European countries from 1999 to 2004, but sales of Fairtrade bananas only went up in three out of the five countries. Overall, the UK saw by far the highest levels of spending on the two products.</p>
<p>In 1999, Switzerland had the highest sales of Fairtrade coffee, at €3 million, while revenue from Fairtrade bananas was highest in the UK, at €15 million. By 2004, however, sales of Fairtrade coffee in the UK had risen to €20 million, and this was over three times higher than Switzerland’s sales figure for Fairtrade coffee in that year. The year 2004 also saw dramatic increases in the money spent on Fairtrade bananas in the UK and Switzerland, with revenues rising by €32 million and €4.5 million respectively.</p>
<p>Sales of the two Fairtrade products were far lower in Denmark, Belgium and Sweden. Small increases in sales of Fairtrade coffee can be seen, but revenue remained at €2 million or below in all three countries in both years. Finally, it is noticeable that the money spent on Fairtrade bananas actually fell in Belgium and Sweden.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em><br>This report is a bit longer (216 words) than necessary, but I think it's a useful model answer in terms of its structure and the language used.</p>

<p>Looking again at the table below, one problem that we have is how to separate the information into two groups, for paragraphs 3 and 4.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c01b7c7eabb00970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="6a0120a5bb05d8970c01b7c7e782d0970b-500wi" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c01b7c7eabb00970b img-responsive" src="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c01b7c7eabb00970b-500wi" title="6a0120a5bb05d8970c01b7c7e782d0970b-500wi"></a></p>
<p>Examiners like comparisons, so I would prefer <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> to write a separate paragraph for each table. Because the countries and the years are the same, I would try to compare the information in the two tables.</p>
<p>So how can we separate the information in a different way? Here's what my students and I did:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paragraph 3: Write about sales of both products in the UK and Switzerland (which have the highest figures).</li>
<li>Paragraph 4: Say something about sales of the two products in the other three countries.</li>

<p><strong>It took me less than 5 minutes to write the following overview:</strong></p>
<p>It is clear that sales of Fairtrade coffee rose in all five European countries from 1999 to 2004, but sales of Fairtrade bananas only went up in three out of the five countries. Overall, the UK saw by far the highest levels of spending on the two products.</p>

<p><strong>Part 1</strong><br>First five minutes: read the question, understand it, underline key figures or trends, <em><strong>and</strong></em> write your one-sentence introduction.</p>
<p><strong>Parts 2, 3 and 4</strong><br>Five minutes for each paragraph: overview, details, details.</p>
<p>Let's start with the first 5 minutes. Go to last week's <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2015/10/ielts-writing-task-1-table.html" target="_self" title="">lesson</a>, read the question, underline key information, and write your introduction by paraphrasing the question statement.

<p>Here are some examples, with <span style="text-decoration: underline;">problems underlined</span>:</p>

<p>If you ask a question like this, it tells me that you're focusing on the wrong thing. Your method, or your whole approach to the IELTS test is wrong.</p>
<p>When you look at a graph or chart in writing task 1, you shouldn't be thinking, "can I use the passive to describe this information?". You should be thinking, "what is the main trend, which numbers should I compare or contrast, how will I paraphrase the question etc.?".</p>
<p>Don't take a 'grammar approach' to your IELTS preparation. Take a 'task response' approach: focus on answering the question.</p>

<p><em><strong>The diagrams below show the site of a school in 2004 and the plan for changes to the school site in 2024.</strong></em></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><em>(Source: Official IELTS Practice Materials 2)</em></span></p>
<p>The two pictures compare the layout of a school as it was in the year 2004 with a proposed site design for the year 2024.</p>
<p>It is clear that the main change for 2024 involves the addition of a new school building. The school will then be able to accommodate a considerably larger number of students.</p>
<p>In 2004, there were 600 pupils attending the school, and the two school buildings were separated by a path running from the main entrance to the sports field. By 2024, it is expected that there will be 1000 pupils, and a third building will have been constructed. Furthermore, the plan is to join the two original buildings together, creating a shorter path that links the buildings only.</p>
<p>As the third building and a second car park will be built on the site of the original sports field, a new, smaller sports field will need to be laid. A new road will also be built from the main entrance to the second car park. Finally, no changes will be made to the main entrance and original car park.</p>

	<p>
				<p>When I was at school I studied French. The teachers taught us lots of grammar, and after five or six years we were ready to learn passives, conditionals and the subjunctive. These were considered to be the the most advanced aspects of the language.</p>
<p>But then I went to France, and realised that I was still a beginner! I couldn't understand fast speech, and I couldn't express myself without thinking first; I needed time to construct sentences in my head.</p>
<p>Now I have a different view about what 'advanced' or 'difficult' language is, and <em><strong>the IELTS marking system agrees with me</strong></em>. An 'advanced' user of English isn't someone who uses lots of passives and conditionals. An advanced user is someone who has a large language <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2011/10/ielts-advice-your-repertoire.html" target="_self" title="">repertoire</a>, can explain ideas in detail, can speak without thinking (too much), and can express the same idea in a variety of ways. Which type of 'advanced' are you tryng to reach?</p>

	<p>
				<p>In yesterday's lesson, I wrote this:</p>
<p><em>The fact that I wrote about 3 distinct ideas meant that the paragraph "moves forward". Many students seem to get stuck on one idea, and the paragraph has no development or “movement".</em></p>
<p>This is something that I often see in students' essays: they go "round and round" explaining the same idea for a whole paragraph. Look carefully at your own paragraphs to see whether this happens to you. If it does, here are 2 possible solutions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Spend more time planning, and try to think of 3 distinct ideas or points before you start writing. When you've written about one point, leave it and move on to the next one.</li>
<li>Spend more time planning, and develop your idea (if you only have one idea). Make sure you don't just explain the same point in different ways. Instead, try to "move the idea forward" by thinking about reasons, consequences and examples. You could even consider alternatives e.g. what the opposite of your idea would be.</li>

<li>I wrote 5 sentences, which is the usual number that I aim for in my main body paragraphs.</li>
<li>The structure was: 1 topic sentence, 1 sentence about the first idea (working hard), 2 sentences about the second idea (good manners), 1 sentence about the third idea (sense of community).</li>
<li>The fact that I wrote about 3 distinct ideas meant that the paragraph "moves forward". Many students seem to get stuck on one idea, and the paragraph has no development or "movement".</li>

	<p>
				<p>Whenever you see a new word or phrase, it's a good idea to investigate. By this I mean that you should search for the word or phrase online, and see how it is used in a variety of sentences.</p>
<p>For example, take this phrase from yesterday's lesson: <em><strong>"I'm not one for..."</strong></em>. If you search for this phrase on Google, you'll see examples like:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm not one for complaining, but...</li>
<li>I'm not one for writing reviews, but...</li>
<li>I'm not one for settling for mediocrity.</li>
<li>I'm not one for love songs.</li>
<li>I'm not one for celeb news.</li>
<li>I'm not one for too much structure.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think you need to see five or more examples of a new phrase before you start to really see how you could use it yourself. Can you see any 'rules' for the phrase "I'm not one for"? Can you explain what it means? Can you use it in your own sentences?</p>

				<p>While I don't recommend memorising full IELTS essays, I'm sure that memorising can be a useful technique that might help you to get the score you need.</p>
<p>So, what can you memorise? Here are some ideas:</p>
<ol>
<li>The correct spelling of any words you have problems with.</li>
<li>Some useful organisational phrases e.g. "It is clear that..." (to begin your summary paragraph for writing task 1).</li>
<li>Some common topics for IELTS speaking part 2 e.g. a description of a hobby, person, place.</li>
<li>Some good topic vocabulary (phrases rather than single words) for IELTS writing task 2.</li>

<p>Can you think of anything else that you could memorise before the exam?</p>

				<p>Here's my full report for the question below. I found this one difficult, so don't worry if you did too!</p>
<p><em><strong>The charts below compare the age structure of the populations of France and India in 1984.</strong></em><br><span style="color: #ffffff;">mm</span></p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c01b7c7a4106c970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="6a0120a5bb05d8970c01bb084082aa970d-800wi" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c01b7c7a4106c970b img-responsive" src="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c01b7c7a4106c970b-800wi" title="6a0120a5bb05d8970c01bb084082aa970d-800wi"></a></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">mm</span><br>The two charts compare the populations of France and India in terms of age distribution by gender in the year 1984.</p>
<p>It is clear that the population of India was younger than that of France in 1984, with a noticeably larger proportion of people aged under 20. France, on the other hand, had a significantly larger percentage of elderly inhabitants.</p>
<p>In India, close to 14% of people were aged 5 or under, and each five-year age bracket above this contained an increasingly smaller proportion of the population. France’s population, by contrast, was more evenly distributed across the age ranges, with similar figures (around 7% to 8% of all people) for each five-year cohort between the ages of 0 and 40. Somewhere between 10% and 15% of all French people were aged 70 or older, but the equivalent figure for India was only 2%.</p>
<p>Looking more closely at gender, there was a noticeably higher proportion of French women than men in every cohort from age 50 upwards. For example, almost 3% of French 70- to 75-year-olds were women, while just under 2% were men. No significant gender differences can be seen on the Indian population chart.</p>

	<p>
				<p>This week someone asked me a question which included the following statement:</p>
<p><em>Some examiners do not agree with the use of "I" in the writing test.</em></p>
<p>My question is: who are these examiners? I can't believe that examiners would ignore their training and penalise the use of "I". How are candidates expected to answer the question "Do <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you</span> agree or disagree?" without using "I" or "my" (e.g. I completely disagree)? Also, if the personal pronoun "you" is used in the question, why would personal pronouns be prohibited in your answer?</p>
<p>My guess is that this misinformation about the use of "I" is coming from teachers, not examiners. In my experience here in the UK, examiners are all well trained and they all work in the same way. They <em><strong>expect</strong></em> you to use phrases like "I believe" or "I agree" when the question asks for your opinion!</p>

	<p>
				<p>A few people asked me to put the 'waste' pie chart paragraphs together in one place. So here's the full report that my students and I wrote. You can see the pie charts by clicking <a href="https://img856.imageshack.us/img856/7830/e9cd.png" target="_self" title="">here</a>.</p>
<p><em><strong>The pie charts below show how dangerous waste products are dealt with in three countries.</strong></em></p>
<p>The charts compare Korea, Sweden and the UK in terms of the methods used in each country to dispose of harmful waste.</p>
<p>It is clear that in both the UK and Sweden, the majority of dangerous waste products are buried underground. By contrast, most hazardous materials in the Republic of Korea are recycled.</p>
<p>Looking at the information in more detail, we can see that 82% of the UK’s dangerous waste is put into landfill sites. This disposal technique is used for 55% of the harmful waste in Sweden and only 22% of similar waste in Korea. The latter country recycles 69% of hazardous materials, which is far more than the other two nations.</p>
<p>While 25% of Sweden's dangerous waste is recycled, the UK does not recycle at all. Instead, it dumps waste at sea or treats it chemically. These two methods are not employed in Korea or Sweden, which favour incineration for 9% and 20% of dangerous waste respectively.</p>

				<p>Many students ask me for advice about how to improve their scores. Or they ask me to explain why they didn't get higher scores in their exams.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I can't give good advice if I don't know the person. To give good advice, I need to be able to identify the problem, and the only way to do that is by speaking to the student and reading some of his/her essays.</p>
<p>So, here's my tip for today: If you want to improve your score, first you need to identify what your problems are. You might need to invest in a few lessons with a teacher who can help you with this.</p>

	<p>
				<p>At the end of yesterday's speaking lesson, I made an important point:</p>
<p>You need to be <em><strong>conscious</strong></em> of the techniques that you are using as you answer questions in the exam (especially in the speaking and writing tests). Otherwise you'll go back to your 'old technique' of saying or writing whatever comes into your head.</p>
<p>Let me explain this a bit more with an example:</p>
<p>When I teach students the 3-step technique that I mentioned yesterday (answer, explain, example), they have no problem understanding it. However, when I then ask some sample questions, most people seem to forget the technique completely. They miss the example, or they give a list of two or three answers with no explanation.</p>
<p><strong>Ask yourself:</strong> are you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">consciously</span> using the exam techniques that you have learnt, or do you fall back into old habits when under pressure?</p>

	<p>
				<p>Yesterday I explained why nobody can create a list of 'band 9 phrases for any essay'. So, is there any way to prepare band 7-9 vocabulary for the test?</p>
<p>The answer is yes, but I'm afraid you will need to make many lists, not just one! I advise my students to prepare ideas and opinions for as many common IELTS topics as possible. <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2011/02/ielts-advice-you-need-ideas-and-opinions.html" target="_self" title="">Click here</a> to see the basic list that I use.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here's an interesting question that someone asked me on Facebook:</p>
<p><em>Can you add on your blog some typical phrases (band 9) that we can use in every essay?</em></p>
<p>This seems to be the 'secret' that so many people are looking for. The problem is that these phrases <em><strong>do not exist</strong></em>. I'll try to explain why.</p>
<p>To get a high score for vocabulary and task response, you need to use words and phrases that are specific to the particular question that you are given. For example, if the question is about the environment, you could write about 'greenhouse gases' or 'carbon dioxide emissions'. But these phrases cannot be used in every essay; they are only relevant to this one topic.</p>
<p>The only phrases that can be used in every essay would be 'linking' phrases, and these do not contribute to your vocabulary or task response scores. They only help you to organise your ideas.</p>
<p>So, please stop looking for 'any essay' phrases. Tomorrow I'll explain what to do instead.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Yesterday I explained why it's normal for your scores to fluctuate between tests. Now I'm going to try to suggest some ways to deal with this.</p>
<p><strong>1. Keep retaking the test</strong></p>
<p>This advice might surprise you, but I remember a student who booked 4 tests in one month. He understood that his scores would fluctuate, but he hoped to improve his chances of having a 'lucky day' when everything went well. It worked! The student told me that the main benefit of taking the test every week was that he stopped feeling nervous. On the third Saturday he performed well in all 4 parts of the test and achieved the scores he needed. <em>*But read the warning below!</em></p>
<p><strong>2. Practise until you over-perform</strong></p>
<p>To get a band 7 in exam conditions, you probably need to be achieving band 7.5 when practising at home. Most people perform worse in real tests due to nerves, so make sure you can comfortably get the score you need before taking the test.</p>
<p><strong>3. Be more consistent in your approach</strong></p>
<p>You might think that you always write essays in the same way, but most people don't. One of my aims in these lessons is to encourage people to use the exact same method every time. For example, I always try to write&nbsp;<a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2015/02/ielts-writing-task-1-9-sentences.html" target="_self" title="">9 sentences</a> for writing task 1, and&nbsp;<a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2015/02/ielts-writing-task-2-13-sentences.html" target="_self" title="">13 sentences</a> for task 2. If you can't say how many sentences you usually write, you're probably not being consistent. I'm using writing as an example, but there are methods for the other parts too.</p>
<p><em><strong>Notes:</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>*<em>Warning</em>: Strategy number 1 can be expensive, and there are no guarantees that it will work. Only try this if you are able to get the score you need in each part and you keep missing your target by 0.5 band in just one part of the test.</li>
<li>Strategy&nbsp;number 2 is sensible, but some people don't want to wait until they can over-perfom.</li>
<li>Strategy&nbsp;number 3 is my favourite. If I can help students to become more consistent, I feel like I'm doing my job as a teacher!</li>
</ul>

	<p>
				<p>People often wonder why their IELTS scores fluctuate. For example, they might get a band 7 in writing one week, but only band 6 or 6.5 the next week.</p>
<p>Does this mean that the test is unreliable or that you had a bad examiner?</p>
<p>Probably not. Fluctuations are normal, both in the exam and when you are practising at home. For example, I've seen the same fluctuations in the quality of students' homework. Sometimes they have great ideas for the essay topic, or they find the answers easily in a reading test. Other times everything seems to go wrong; they have a bad day, and get lower scores.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I'll talk a bit more about this, and I'll try to suggest some strategies for dealing with this 'fluctuation' problem.</p>

The raw materials are melted in a furnace at very high temperatures, typically between 1,300°C to 1,500°C. The smoke created during this process is filtered and flue gases are cleaned to minimise any environmental impact. The droplets of melt exiting the furnace are spun into fibres. Small quantities of binding agents are added to the fibres. The mineral wool is then hardened in a curing oven at around 200°C. The mineral wool is cut to the required size and shape.</em></p>

	<p>
				<p>How do you know when you're ready to take the IELTS exam? Here's my advice:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you've never taken the exam before, take it as soon as you can. You'll be surprised how difficult a full day of testing is! Treat your first attempt as a practice test to get used to what it 'feels' like. Also, taking the exam is the best way to assess your level.</li>
<li>Your next step could be to read about the best ways (techniques, methods) of doing each part of the exam; this is what I try to provide here on the website. Read my advice, analyse my model answers, and try to copy the way I approach each part of the test.</li>
<li>Using what you have learnt, you need to practise and train yourself. This is not the same as testing yourself. Read <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2015/03/ielts-advice-testing-or-training.html" target="_self" title="">yesterday's lesson</a> to understand the difference.</li>
<li>Finally, you need to do some tests and get feedback. You need to find out what you are doing wrong and what you need to do to improve. The best form of feedback is from a teacher who can read your essays or listen to you speak.</li>
</ol>
<p>You will know that you are ready when you consistently get the score you need in all of your practice tests.</p>

<li>or work on particular grammar mistakes</li>
<li>or work on a technique for a particular part of the exam</li>
</ul>
<p>A good example of training is when you practise writing introductions. Sometimes I spend a whole lesson with my students just doing different introductions. We practise one technique until students become good at it.</p>
<p>So, how much 'training' and how much 'testing' should you do? Well, a good idea might be to spend Monday to Friday training, preparing and working on language. Then test yourself at the weekend - if you've worked hard, you might see an improvement!</p>

	<p>
				<p>I've just published a video lesson about process diagrams on <a href="http://subscriptions.viddler.com/SimonCorcoran" target="_self" title="">this webpage</a>.</p>
<p>In the video lesson I focus on the most common type of process diagram, a production process. Here's the question that I used:</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c01b7c760a2f2970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Process photo" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c01b7c760a2f2970b img-responsive" src="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c01b7c760a2f2970b-320wi" title="Process photo"></a></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><em>(Click on the picture above to enlarge it)</em></span></p>
<p>Apart from the 'production process', there are two other types of process diagram:</p>
<ol>
<li>Natural process diagram: click <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2013/01/ielts-writing-task-1-life-cycle-essay.html" target="_self" title="">here</a> to see an example.</li>

</ol>
<p>The technique is basically the same for all 3 types of process, but it's a good idea to practise an example of each.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Speaking</span><br>Focus on vocabulary instead of grammar or linking. In parts 2 and 3, explain your ideas in detail to increase your vocabulary score.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Listening</span><br>Use the breaks to read ahead. When they give you half a minute to check your answers, <strong><em>don't</em></strong>. Use the time to get ready for the next section.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reading</span><br>Get to the end! Miss the questions you find difficult, and make sure you do all of the easier ones. Return to the harder questions if you have time.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Writing Task 1</span><br>Write a good overview. Examiners want to see a summary of the information, as well as detailed description.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Writing Task 2</span><br>Spend more time planning. A good plan will help you to write a more organised essay with better ideas.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Personally, I would start with task 1.</strong></p>
<p>You'll be feeling nervous in the exam, so it's a good idea to start with something easy: the introduction to task 1.

				<p>Sometimes the noun form and the verb form of a word are the same. For example, the word “increase” can be a noun or a verb. The problem is that nouns and verbs are used differently. Here are some examples:</p>

				<p>A student asked me the following question:</p>
<p><em>Will it help my score if I write a longer essay for writing task 2 - because a longer essay will contain more vocabulary?</em></p>
<p>Here's my answer:</p>
<p>Quality is more important than quantity in the IELTS writing test. If you write a longer essay, you <em><strong>might</strong></em> demonstrate a wider range of vocabulary. On the other hand, you might just repeat the same ideas, and you might make more mistakes.</p>
<p>I don't teach my students to write longer essays (anything over 250 words is fine). I teach them to spend 10 minutes planning good ideas, rather than trying to write more words. In my view, planning is the secret to improving the quality.</p>

<li>There is an array of reasons for the proliferation of high amounts of waste disposal.</li>
<li>There are various reasons for the rise in the amount of waste that we produce.</li>
</ol>
<p>Although sentence 1 might look more 'difficult' (due to the use of <em>array</em>, <em>proliferation</em> and <em>disposal</em>), I definitely prefer sentence 2.</p>
<p>The problem with sentence 1 is that it seems forced and unnatural:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Array of reasons" is fine, although no better than "various reasons".</li>
<li>"Proliferation" and "high amounts" sound strange together. I would use one or the other, but not both.</li>
<li>"The proliferation of waste disposal" also sounds wrong to a native speaker. It isn't a collocation that I would expect to read or hear.</li>
<li>I think the topic would be about "waste production", not "waste disposal". The root problem is that we are producing more waste, not that we are throwing it away more often. The word "disposal" looks good, but for me it affects the coherence of the sentence.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think this is a great example of what I said in Wednesday's <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2015/01/ielts-writing-task-2-the-confidence-to-be-simple.html" target="_self" title="">lesson</a> about having the confidence to keep it simple.

	<p>
				<p>A student, Kishanth, asked me about two of the points in the grammar criterion for band 8 writing (both task 1 and 2):</p>
<ul>
<li>uses a wide range of structures</li>
<li>the majority of sentences are error-free</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Here's the problem with these two points:</strong><br>When you try to use a wide range of grammatical structures, you risk making more mistakes (errors). But to reduce the number of mistakes, you might have to simplify your sentences.</p>
<p><strong>So what should you do?</strong><br>My advice is this: Forget about the 'wide range of structures' point. If all of your focus is on using complex grammar, you'll probably do something worse than just make mistakes; you'll probably forget to answer the question properly. The people who worry most about grammar usually neglect <em>task response</em>, <em>coherence</em> and <em>vocabulary</em>.</p>
<p>For me, grammar is the least important criterion to worry about. I tell students to focus on the other 75% of the scoring system: task response, coherence and vocabulary. However, if you want my tip for improving your grammar score, I'd say that it's better to focus on reducing errors. I think examiners notice errors more than they notice grammatical range, and if you write a mix of short and long sentences, you'll probably fulfil the 'wide range of structures' requirement without realising it.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #ffffff;">...</span><br>Here's my full band 9 report:</strong></p>
<p>The diagrams compare two different methods of defence for homes which are at risk of being flooded.</p>
<p>The key difference between the diagrams is that they show flood protection with and without a stopbank. In either case, the at-risk home is raised on stilts above ground level.</p>
<p>The first diagram shows how a stopbank acts as a flood barrier to stop river water from flooding homes. The stopbank is a small mound of land next to the river that is higher than the 100-year flood level, and prevents the river from bursting its banks. Nearby houses can be built on stilts to prevent flooding from rainwater, and a floodgate beneath the stopbank can be opened to allow this ‘ponding’ to drain off into the river.</p>
<p>When there is no stopbank, as shown in the second diagram, there will be nothing to stop the river from flooding. In this case, the solution is to put buildings on stilts. The height of the stilts is measured so that the floor of the house is 300mm above the 100-year flood level. This measurement is called the ‘freeboard’.</p>

				<p>Students often write to me asking about a strange or difficult question that they have found. Personally, I think that studying strange questions is a waste of time when there are some really common topics that appear again and again.</p>
<p>Topics like education, family and work in the writing test, and 'describe a person' or 'describe a place' in the speaking test are so common that you should definitely prepare these topics before you start worrying about any unusual questions.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Students often ask me questions like: "Can you explain phrasal verbs?" or "Can you explain prepositions?"</p>
<p>The problem is that the word&nbsp;<em><strong>explain</strong></em> implies that phrasal verbs and prepositions are grammar issues with easy rules. In fact, there are no easy rules to explain phrasal verbs, prepositions, and many other areas of language. Instead of treating these things as 'grammar', it's easier to see them as vocabulary items.</p>
<p>In any language, some things can be explained using grammar rules. Everything else is vocabulary. You don't need to <em><strong>explain</strong></em> vocabulary; you just need to learn it gradually.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> vocabulary knowledge is the key to a high IELTS score!</p>

	<p>
				<p>These two words are often confused by students. Here is the main difference:</p>
<ul>
<li>something rises (e.g. the price rose)</li>
<li>somebody raises something (e.g. the company raised the price)</li>
</ul>
<p>"Rise" (rose, risen) can be a verb or a noun. I often use it for IELTS writing task 1:</p>
<ul>
<li>The price of cigarettes <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">rises</span> every year. (verb, present)</li>
<li>In 2008, the number of customers <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">rose </span><span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">from</span> 100 <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">to</span> 200. (verb, past)</li>

</ul>
<p>"Raise" (raised) is almost always a verb. You probably won't use it for task 1:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Government raises the price of cigarettes every year.</li>
<li>Charities work to raise the standard of living in developing countries.</li>

<p>The chart compares the amounts of waste that were produced in six countries in the years 1980, 1990 and 2000.</p>
<p>In each of these years, the US produced more waste than Ireland, Japan, Korea, Poland and Portugal combined. It is also noticeable that Korea was the only country that managed to reduce its waste output by the year 2000.</p>
<p>Between 1980 and 2000, waste production in the US rose from 131 to 192 million tonnes, and rising trends were also seen in Japan, Poland and Portugal. Japan’s waste output increased from 28 to 53 million tonnes, while Poland and Portugal saw waste totals increase from 4 to 6.6 and from 2 to 5 million tonnes respectively.</p>
<p>The trends for Ireland and Korea were noticeably different from those described above. In Ireland, waste production increased more than eightfold, from only 0.6 million tonnes in 1980 to 5 million tonnes in 2000.

<ol>
<li>6% of single aged people were living in poverty.</li>
<li>The level of poverty among single aged people stood at 6%.</li>
</ol>
<p>You could also add a comparison:</p>
<ol>
<li>6% of single aged people were living in poverty, compared to only 4% of aged couples.</li>
<li>The level of poverty among single aged people stood at 6%, whereas the figure for aged couples was only 4%.</li>
</ol>
<p>Which sentence do you think is clearer? Also, why have I used "people" and "couples" in my sentences when the table says "person" and "couple"?</p>

<p>Notice that I use <em><strong>I'd</strong></em> instead of the full <em><strong>I would</strong></em> because these are spoken answers (although it's fine to say <em><strong>I would</strong></em>).</p>
<p>Notice also that the 'if' conditional clause is missing from the second example. Sometimes we miss the condition because it is understood from the context. We understand from the context that I mean: "If I redecorated my home, that's what I would change first".</p>

				<p>In yesterday's lesson I suggested that the sign of an advanced learner of English is the ability to express the same thing in different ways. But how can you get better at doing this?</p>
<p><strong>Here's a simple exercise:</strong><br>Imagine that you have to explain a word, phrase or idea to somebody who doesn't understand it. You have to explain it in as many different ways as you can, until you are sure that the other person understands.</p>

<p>As a native speaker, I could keep going and add several more phrases to this list. The same happens in IELTS contexts: <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2014/09/ielts-writing-task-1-variety.html" target="_self" title="">click here</a> to see an example.</p>

<p>The pie charts compare the expenditure of a school in the UK in three different years over a 20-year period.</p>
<p>It is clear that teachers’ salaries made up the largest proportion of the school’s spending in all three years (1981, 1991 and 2001). By contrast, insurance was the smallest cost in each year.</p>
<p>In 1981, 40% of the school’s budget went on teachers’ salaries. This figure rose to 50% in 1991, but fell again by 5% in 2001. The proportion of spending on other workers’ wages fell steadily over the 20-year period, from 28% of the budget in 1981 to only 15% in 2001.</p>
<p>Expenditure on insurance stood at only 2% of the total in 1981, but reached 8% in 2001. Finally, the percentages for resources and furniture/equipment fluctuated.

	<p>
				<p>Many students are overly worried about the examiner. They worry about body language, eye contact, how friendly the examiner is, whether the examiner smiles, whether he/she is making notes, what his/her opinion might be etc.</p>
<p>This kind of worrying is a waste of time and energy. My advice is that you should only worry about 2 things in the speaking test: 1) listening carefully to the questions 2) trying your best to give good answers. It's a language exam, so let's worry about language.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Last week I asked you to think about how to divide the information from 3 pie charts into 2 groups in order to write 2 'details' paragraphs (<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://ielts-simon.com/files/screen-shot-2013-03-27-at-13.21.47-1.png"><span class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c017d42850805970c">click here</span></a> to see the pie charts again).</p>
<p><strong>Here are two paragraphs that I wrote with my students:</strong></p>
<p>In 1981, 40% of the school’s budget went on <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">teachers’ salaries</span>. This figure rose to 50% in 1991, but fell again by 5% in 2001. The proportion of spending on <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">other workers’ wages</span> fell steadily over the 20-year period, from 28% of the budget in 1981 to only 15% in 2001.</p>
<p>Expenditure on <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">insurance</span> stood at only 2% of the total in 1981, but reached 8% in 2001. Finally, the percentages for <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">resources</span> and <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">furniture/equipment</span> fluctuated. The figure for resources was highest in 1991, at 20%, and the proportion of spending on furniture and equipment reached its peak in 2001, at 23%.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong><br>You can see that I chose to put the <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">two types of salaries</span> together in one paragraph, and the <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">other three categories</span> together in the second paragraph.

	<p>
				<p>Have you tried using Google (or another search engine) to resolve grammar problems? For example, students asked me to explain the following sentences from the <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2014/09/ielts-writing-task-2-happiness-essay.html" target="_self" title="">essay</a> in Wednesday's lesson:</p>

<li>There are some basic preconditions <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to</span> achiev<span style="text-decoration: underline;">ing</span> happiness.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">There do seem to be</span> some common needs that we all share.</li>
<li>It is no doubt true that...</li>
</ol>
<p>If we put quotation marks ("...") around the key words, and Google them, we can look for patterns in the search results that help us to understand the grammar.</p>
<p><em><strong>Example:</strong></em><br>Try searching for "preconditions to achieving", then try "preconditions to being" and "preconditions to doing". The search results should show you that "preconditions to +ing" is a normal grammar pattern in English.</p>
<p>Now search for "there do seem to be" and "it is no doubt true that". You might find that searching for grammar patterns is more useful than learning grammar rules.</p>

<p>The table compares the numbers of people who cycled to work in twelve areas of the UK in the years 2001 and 2011.</p>
<p>Overall, the number of UK commuters who travelled to work by bicycle rose considerably over the 10-year period. Inner London had by far the highest number of cycling commuters in both years.</p>
<p>In 2001, well over 43 thousand residents of inner London commuted by bicycle, and this figure rose to more than 106 thousand in 2011, an increase of 144%. By contrast, although outer London had the second highest number of cycling commuters in each year, the percentage change, at only 45%, was the lowest of the twelve areas shown in the table.</p>
<p>Brighton and Hove saw the second biggest increase (109%) in the number of residents cycling to work, but Bristol was the UK’s second city in terms of total numbers of cycling commuters, with 8,108 in 2001 and 15,768 in 2011. Figures for the other eight areas were below the 10 thousand mark in both years.</p>

				<p><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><em>From Simon: I've been busy moving house today, which is why this lesson is so late!</em></span></p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> How should you structure your task 1 report if the question shows two different charts (e.g. a line graph and a pie chart)?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> It's easy. Just follow the 4-paragraph structure below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Introduction - say what each chart shows (one or two sentences)</li>
<li>Overview - write one sentence about each chart, describing it's main feature</li>
<li>Describe the first chart in detail</li>
<li>Describe the second chart in detail</li>
</ol>

	<p>
				<p>To get a high vocabulary score, you should try to use a good <em><strong>range</strong></em> of vocabulary. However, this <span style="text-decoration: underline;">doesn't</span> mean that 'strange' or 'difficult' words are the secret to success.</p>
<p>The vocabulary that you use also needs to be <em><strong>natural</strong></em> and <em><strong>appropriate</strong></em> to the style of the essay or report that you are writing. This is the reason why I suggested avoiding words like 'plummet' and 'rocket' in writing task 1. These words are not normally used in academic-style reports (because they exaggerate too much), whereas 'fall' and 'increase significantly' seem much more natural and appropriate.</p>

	<p>
				<p>In Thursday's <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2014/08/ielts-writing-task-1-nouns-and-verbs.html" target="_self" title="">lesson</a> I suggested that you should avoid using words like soar, rocket and plummet when describing changes on a graph or chart. I explained that these words exaggerate too much, and that they are not 'academic'.</p>
<p>But someone asked this sensible question:</p>
<p><em>How can we get a high score for lexical resource (vocabulary) if we only use common words like 'increase', 'rise' and 'fall'?</em></p>
<p>The quick answer is that it's better to use 'less common vocabulary' for other aspects of your description. If you analyse <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2014/05/ielts-writing-task-1-bar-chart-essay.html" target="_self" title="">this</a> band 9 essay, you'll see that I used common words like <em>rose</em>, <em>decreased</em>, <em>reaching</em> and <em>dropped</em> to describe changes, but I managed to use 'less common vocabulary' for other aspects of my description e.g. global turnover, devices, namely, platform.</p>
<p>I'll explain more about how to get a high vocabulary score tomorrow.</p>

	<p>
				<p>When describing changes I prefer to avoid words like <em>soar</em>, <em>rocket</em> and <em>plummet</em> because they are too "sensationalist" - they exaggerate too much, and are more journalistic than academic in style.</p>
<p>Instead, we can demonstrate good control of grammar by using words like <strong><em>increase</em></strong>, <strong><em>rise</em></strong> and <strong>fall</strong> as both nouns and verbs:</p>
<p>- London saw <em><strong>a significant increase</strong></em> in the cost of homes. (noun)<br> - The cost of homes in London <em><strong>increased significantly</strong></em>. (verb)</p>

<p>The line graph compares levels of unemployment among 16 to 24-year-olds with overall unemployment figures over a period of 20 years in England.</p>
<p>It is clear that the proportion of young adults who were unemployed at any time between 1993 and 2012 was significantly higher than the overall proportion of adults without work. Unemployment rates for both groups of adults were consistently higher in London than in the rest of England.</p>

				<p>I often meet students who have learnt ten different ways to paraphrase "the graph shows". If you look in a dictionary, you'll find many synonyms for the word "show" (e.g. display, exhibit, parade, depict, convey). But is it a good idea to use these synonyms?</p>
<p>The answer is no.</p>
<p>First, most synonyms of the word "show" are not appropriate for descriptions of a graph or chart. The phrase "the graph exhibits" will look very strange to the examiner. Second, if you learn ten synonyms, you'll probably waste time deciding which one to use.</p>
<p>I tell my students to remember just two synonyms for "shows": <em><strong>compares</strong></em> and <em><strong>illustrates</strong></em> (e.g. the bar chart compares; the diagram illustrates). It won't help your score if you use a strange synonym that you found in a dictionary.</p>

	<p>
				<p>A lot of people ask me what they should do to improve their scores. Generally speaking, there are only two things that you can do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Work on your exam technique</li>
<li>Work on your English</li>
</ol>
<p>I can often help students to make fast improvements by teaching them how to organise their essays, how to look for keywords in the reading test, or how to expand their answers in the speaking test. These are exam techniques.</p>
<p>However, exam techniques alone will not get you a band 7. You need a good level of English to get a 7, and that means you need to do the hard work it takes to gradually learn more words and phrases, improve your speaking fluency, and generally become a more confident user of the language.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em><br>Point 2 takes time. Don't expect your English to improve from 5.5 to 7 without a lot of work!</p>

<p>The picture illustrates the process of producing electricity in a home using solar panels.</p>
<p>It is clear that there are five distinct stages in this process, beginning with the capture of energy from sunlight. The final two steps show how domestic electricity is connected to the external power supply.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">At the first stage</span> in the process, solar panels on the roof of a normal house take energy from the sun and convert it into DC current. Next, this current <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is passed</span> to an inverter, which changes it to AC current and regulates the supply of electricity. At stage three, electricity is supplied to the home from an electrical panel.</p>
<p>At the fourth step shown on the diagram, a utility meter in the home is responsible for sending any extra electric power outside the house into the grid. Finally, if the solar panels do not provide enough energy for the household, electricity will flow from the utility grid into the home through the meter.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em><br>I've underlined examples of the two language features that make process diagram descriptions special: 'steps' language, and passive verbs.</p>

				<p>If you have a grammar question, this website probably isn't the best place to find the answer. There are many dedicated grammar sites, so all you need to do is put your problem into a search engine (e.g. Google).</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>A student asked me to explain how to use "not only... but also...".

<p>After reading the explanation of "not only... but also...", you could try making your own sentences about common IELTS topics, such as education, work or the environment.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Many students want to know how long it will take to get the score they need. It's impossible for me to answer this question because it depends on too many things. For example:</p>
<p>- How many hours of study do you do each day?<br>- What kind of study do you do?<br>- Do you have a teacher or someone who can help you?<br>- Do you live in an English-speaking country?<br>- Do you like learning English, or do you just need an IELTS score?</p>
<p>Maybe the last question is the most important one. In my experience, people who enjoy learning English tend to make the fastest progress.</p>

				<p>Here's my full essay for <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2014/05/ielts-writing-task-1-bar-chart.html" target="_self" title="">last week's question</a>:</p>
<p>The bar chart compares the turnover in dollars from sales of video games for four different platforms, namely mobile phones, online, consoles and handheld devices, from 2000 to 2006.</p>
<p>It is clear that sales of games for three out of the four platforms rose each year, leading to a significant rise in total global turnover over the 7-year period. Sales figures for handheld games were at least twice as high as those for any other platform in almost every year.</p>
<p>In 2000, worldwide sales of handheld games stood at around $11 billion, while console games earned just under $6 billion. No figures are given for mobile or online games in that year. Over the next 3 years, sales of handheld video games rose by about $4 billion, but the figure for consoles decreased by $2 billion. Mobile phone and online games started to become popular, with sales reaching around $3 billion in 2003.</p>
<p>In 2006, sales of handheld, online and mobile games reached peaks of 17, 9 and 7 billion dollars respectively. By contrast, turnover from console games dropped to its lowest point, at around $2.5 billion.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Can you write an error-free sentence? How about an error-free paragraph?</p>
<p>If you want to get a band 7 or higher for IELTS writing, the examiner needs to see that you "regularly write error-free sentences". This means that several of the sentences in your essays should contain <em><strong>no</strong></em> mistakes.</p>
<p>The best way to improve your grammatical accuracy is by learning from your mistakes. Try to find a teacher or native speaker who can check your work and highlight the errors. Then make sure you understand the mistakes you made, and try to avoid making them again. Aim to write more error-free sentences each time you write an essay.</p>

	<p>
				<p>I'd like to share some feedback that a student sent me recently. What I particularly like is that the student talks about "having good habits". For me, good habits are the secret to success!</p>
<p><em>Hi Simon,</em></p>
<p><em>I am so excited to tell you that I finally got 7.0 in writing! Additionally I got overall 8.0 which is my personal best score ever. While practising writing skills after your course, I remembered how you demonstrated writing, beginning with brainstorming, followed by organising the ideas, then putting it all into sentences. It seemed very easy and I tried to write as you wrote both in practice and in the examination. Magic happened. I finished writing task 2 with 5 minutes extra time! Unbelievable.</em></p>
<p><em>This clearly shows how your message of "having a good habit" is extremely powerful. I have applied this message in my daily life and hopefully I will pass medical examinations to be qualified as a doctor in this country very soon.</em></p>
<p><em>Thank you very much!</em></p>

	<p>
				<p>I noticed a comment under last week's <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2014/03/ielts-writing-task-1-map-essay.html" target="_self" title="">map</a> lesson from a student who suggested that we could ignore maps because they are much less common than graphs and charts.</p>
<p>While it's true that graphs and charts are the most common types of question, I think it would be very unwise not to prepare for diagrams and maps too. What happens if you get one of these questions in your test and you haven't prepared for it?</p>
<p>Another point to note is that diagrams and maps are <em><strong>really easy</strong></em> to describe if you know what you're doing. Taking the time to study the lessons I've written about them could turn out to be a very good idea.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Many students (and some teachers!) have the wrong idea about what a band 7, 8 or 9 essay looks like. For example, a few people commented that they thought the essay in <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2014/03/ielts-writing-task-2-independence-question.html" target="_self" title="">this lesson</a> wasn't good enough for a high score.</p>
<p>Please remember that the IELTS exam is a test for non-native speakers of English, not professional English writers. It's much easier than some people think to write a good IELTS essay. Don't try to use strange or 'difficult' language; just keep it clear and simple, and try to develop your ideas so that you fully answer the question.</p>
<p>Some people won't want to believe me, but the essay in Wednesday's lesson would get a band 9.</p>

	<p>
				<p><em><strong>Here is a band 9 answer for</strong></em> <a href="http://www.examda.com/ielts/Files/lq/0606/10822604.jpg">this question</a>:</p>
<p>The map shows the growth of a village called Chorleywood between 1868 and 1994.</p>
<p>It is clear that the village grew as the transport infrastructure was improved. Four periods of development are shown on the map, and each of the populated areas is near to the main roads, the railway or the motorway.</p>
<p>From 1868 to 1883, Chorleywood covered a small area next to one of the main roads. Chorleywood Park and Golf Course is now located next to this original village area. The village grew along the main road to the south between 1883 and 1922, and in 1909 a railway line was built crossing this area from west to east. Chorleywood station is in this part of the village.</p>
<p>The expansion of Chorleywood continued to the east and west alongside the railway line until 1970. At that time, a motorway was built to the east of the village, and from 1970 to 1994, further development of the village took place around motorway intersections with the railway and one of the main roads.</p>
<p><em><strong>Don't just read this essay once. Spend some time analysing it:</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>In what order did I describe the information shown on the map?</li>
<li>What information did I choose for paragraphs 3 and 4?</li>

	<p>
				<p>In last week's <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2014/03/ielts-writing-task-1-sentence-building.html" target="_self" title="">video lesson</a> I followed some easy steps to build the following sentence:</p>
<p><em>The number of Japanese tourists who travelled abroad increased dramatically from just under 5 million to around 15 million between 1985 and 1995, a rise of about 10 million in 10 years.</em></p>
<p>The next step after writing this sentence about Japanese tourists would be to add a comparison with tourists from the other countries shown on the graph or chart. Let's use the chart below as an example (numbers represent millions of tourists who travelled abroad).</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c01a51183d171970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Screen Shot 2014-03-13 at 09.16.42" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c01a51183d171970c img-responsive" src="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c01a51183d171970c-400wi" style="width: 400px;" title="Screen Shot 2014-03-13 at 09.16.42"></a></p>
<p>Here's my original sentence about Japan, with a comparison sentence about Australia and Canada. Look carefully at how I construct the comparison sentence. If you want a good score in writing task 1, these are the kinds of sentences that you need to be able to write!</p>
<p><em>The number of Japanese tourists who travelled abroad increased dramatically from just under 5 million to around 15 million between 1985 and 1995, a rise of about 10 million in 10 years. By contrast, the number of Australians who visited other countries remained stable, at just over 7 million, and the figure for Canada fell slightly, from 6 million travellers in 1985 to 5.5 million in 1995.</em></p>

				<p>I'm a great believer in the power of habits: if you do something often enough, it becomes easier and more natural to you.</p>
<p>An example could be the "why, alternative, example" technique from yesterday's speaking lesson. Imagine practising this technique once a day for a month. You might start to find it easy to give longer answers that include a conditional sentence (the 'alternative' part). This one simple habit could make a real difference in your test.</p>

				<p>One of the most common questions that people ask me is: "How can I improve my score from 6.5 to 7?"</p>
<p>Here's some advice if your current score is 6.5:</p>
<ul>
<li>The good news is that you are not doing anything wrong in terms of exam technique. The fact that you are getting 6.5 means that you are doing the exam in the right way.</li>
<li>You are very close to getting a 7. In the writing and speaking tests, a score of 6.5 means that you are already achieving band 7 in half of the requirements.</li>
<li>You don't need a special technique or piece of advice. You only need to make <em><strong>small improvements</strong></em>. For example, in the speaking and writing tests, try to express your ideas in a bit more detail, and try to reduce the number of small mistakes that you make.</li>

<p>The bar chart shows the number of hot dogs and buns eaten in 15 minutes by the winners of ‘Nathan’s Hot Dog Eating Contest’ in Brooklyn, USA between 1980 and 2010.</p>
<p>It is noticeable that the number of hot dogs and buns eaten by winners of the contest increased dramatically over the period shown. The majority of winners were American or Japanese, and only one woman had ever won the contest.</p>
<p>Americans <span style="text-decoration: underline;">dominated the contest</span> from 1980 to 1996, and the winning number of hot dogs and buns consumed rose from only 8 to around 21 during that time. 1983 and 1984 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">were notable exceptions to the trend</span> for American winners. In 1983 a Mexican won the contest after eating 19.5 hot dogs, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">almost double the amount that any previous winner had eaten</span>, and 1984 saw the only female winner, Birgit Felden from Germany.</p>
<p>A Japanese <span style="text-decoration: underline;">contestant</span>, Takeru Kobayashi, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">reigned as hot dog eating champion</span> for six years from 2001 to 2006. Kobayashi’s <span style="text-decoration: underline;">winning totals</span> of around 50 hot dogs were roughly double the amount that any previous winner had <span style="text-decoration: underline;">managed</span>. However, the current champion, American Joey Chestnut, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">took hot dog eating to new heights</span> in 2009 when he consumed an incredible 68 hot dogs and buns <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in the allotted</span> 15 minutes.</p>

				<p>Several people have asked me about the pie chart question in Cambridge IELTS book 9 (page 76). <a class="asset-img-link" href="http://ielts-simon.com/files/unnamed.jpg"><span class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c01a3fb8407af970b">Click here</span></a> to see the pie charts, then consider the following questions:</p>
<p>1. Which country has the older population?<br>2. What trend do both countries have in common?<br>3. In a 4-paragraph essay, what would each paragraph be about?</p>
<p>I'll continue with this question next week.</p>

				<p>Have you done all of the practice tests (including the general training reading tests) in all nine of the Cambridge books?</p>

<p>If you have, my advice is to do them again! This time, don't use the books for testing. Study and analyse the questions and answers carefully, use a dictionary to look up new vocabulary, try writing essays without a time limit, and record yourself answering the speaking questions. There is so much that you can learn from past exam papers.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Candidates who get higher IELTS scores tend to use a wider range of vocabulary. A quick way to test your 'vocabulary range' is to challenge yourself to explain something in as many different ways as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> I asked my students to explain the word '<strong><em>recreation'</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Short answer:</strong><br>doing things that you enjoy</p>
<p><strong>Longer answer showing a wider vocabulary range:</strong><br>doing things that you enjoy; activities for fun or pleasure; leisure activities; what you do in your free time outside work; maybe pastimes or hobbies; it could include sports, games, or just relaxing and unwinding when you have time to yourself...</p>

	<p>
				<p>Last week I wrote an introduction and an overview for the graph below. Today I'm going to describe specific details.</p>
<p><em><strong>The graph below shows trends in US meat and poultry consumption.</strong></em></p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c019b01ba6347970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="6a0120a5bb05d8970c019b0161cef5970d-500wi" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c019b01ba6347970b" src="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c019b01ba6347970b-500wi" title="6a0120a5bb05d8970c019b0161cef5970d-500wi"></a></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><em>(Note: I'm ignoring the forecast and treating 2012 as a past year)</em></span></p>
<p>Between 1955 and 1976, US beef consumption rose from around 60 to a peak of 90 pounds per person per year. During the same period, consumption of broilers also rose, to nearly 30 pounds per person, while the figures for pork fluctuated between 50 and 40 pounds per person. Turkey was by far the least popular meat, with figures below 10 pounds per capita each year.</p>
<p>By 2012, the amount of beef consumed by the average American had plummeted to around 50 pounds, but the consumption of broilers had doubled since the 1970s, to approximately 55 pounds per capita. By contrast, there were no significant changes in the trends for pork and turkey consumption over the period as a whole.</p>
<p><em><strong>Task:</strong></em><br>Analyse the above paragraphs carefully. Look at which figures I decided to include, the language used for comparisons, and the way I divided the description into two separate paragraphs.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Many students ask me about idioms: What are they? Should you use them? Do they help your score?</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Meaning</span><br>My dictionary defines an idiom as "a group of words whose meaning is not deducible from the meaning of each individual word". This means that you cannot understand an idiom by analysing it word for word. For example, "it's a piece of cake" means "it's easy". Phrasal verbs are also idiomatic expressions (e.g. "look up" can mean "search in a dictionary").</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Using idioms</span><br>English speakers use idioms all the time in conversation, but less so in formal/academic speaking and writing contexts. However, we often write things like "focus on an issue" or "the key to solving a problem" and here we are using 'focus' and 'key' in a figurative or idiomatic way.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Idioms in IELTS</span><br>You need to be really careful when using idioms in your IELTS test. Please don't learn lists of idioms; if you use them in the wrong way, your speech/writing will seem forced and unnatural. Also, remember that many idioms are informal or&nbsp;<a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2011/11/ielts-advice-avoid-proverbs-and-clichés.html" target="_self">clichéd</a>. So, what should you do? Read my tip below.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">My tip</span><br>You can only be sure that you are using an idiom correctly if you have seen or heard it used in context. For example, if you've read about someone who "set up a business", you can use that phrase with confidence (and it might help your score). If you've only seen the idiom on a list, don't use it.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Today I'm going to write the first two paragraphs (introduction and overview) of an essay describing the graph below. I'll finish the essay by describing specific details next week.</p>
<p><em><strong>The graph below shows trends in US meat and poultry consumption.</strong></em></p>

<p><strong>Introduction and overview:</strong></p>
<p>The line graph shows changes in the per capita consumption of beef, pork, broilers and turkey in the United States between 1955 and 2012.</p>
<p>It is noticeable that beef was by far the most popular of the four types of meat for the majority of the 57-year period. However, a considerable rise can be seen in the consumption of broilers, with figures eventually surpassing those for beef.</p>

<p>The description on the website is inappropriate for IELTS because there is too much analysis of reasons why meat eating habits are changing - don't try to give reasons in your IELTS essay!</p>
<p>However, there are a few nice phrases that we can use e.g. <em>Americans are projected to eat 12.2 percent less meat in 2012 than they did in 2007.<br></em></p>

	<p>
				<p>Let's review the approach (method / technique) that I suggest for writing task 1. Your task 1 essay should contain three elements:</p>
<ol>
<li>You need a short <span style="text-decoration: underline;">introduction</span> to explain what the graph, chart or diagram shows. The easiest way to write this is by paraphrasing the question. The examiner will be impressed if you can paraphrase effectively.</li>
<li>You need an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">overview</span> of the information. This means that you need to look at the "big picture", not the individual details. I recommend writing a short paragraph with two sentences that summarise two main things that you can see on the chart. If you forget the overview, you'll get a lower score.</li>
<li>Finally, you need to describe some <span style="text-decoration: underline;">specific details</span>. This is where you select, describe and compare individual pieces of information (usually numbers). I try to separate this description of details into two paragraphs.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you look through the task 1 lessons on this site, you'll see how I include these three elements in every essay.</p>

<p>The flow chart shows how waste paper is recycled. It is clear that there are six distinct stages in this process, from the initial collection of waste paper to the eventual production of usable paper.</p>
<p>At the first stage in the paper recycling process, waste paper is collected either from paper banks, where members of the public leave their used paper, or directly from businesses. This paper is then sorted by hand and separated according to its grade, with any paper that is not suitable for recycling being removed. Next, the graded paper is transported to a paper mill.</p>
<p>Stages four and five of the process both involve cleaning. The paper is cleaned and pulped, and foreign objects such as staples are taken out. Following this, all remnants of ink and glue are removed from the paper at the de-inking stage. Finally, the pulp can be processed in a paper making machine, which makes the end product: usable paper.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Related to yesterday's lesson, here's a question that a student sent me last year:</p>
<p><em>Hi Simon, when you talk about Band 7+ vocabulary, you  always talk about two or three words (a phrase basically).   But I am trying to learn few "heavy" words like cardinal, multitudinous,  prodigious, prestidigitation, peregrination etc.  Can you please tell us what is more important for  IELTS: "heavy words" or good phrases?</em></p>
<p>My answer to this question is simple: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">good phrases</span> are much more important. The words listed by the student above would seem forced and unnatural, whereas good phrases show your ability to use words together like a native speaker would.</p>
<p>Please don't learn the "heavy" words mentioned by the student. Instead, focus on learning good <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2012/10/ielts-writing-task-2-collocations.html" target="_self">collocations</a> for IELTS topics.</p>

	<p>
				<p>I ban my students from using certain words in the IELTS test. The easiest way for me to explain why I ban these words is that most native speakers wouldn't use them if they were doing the test. Here are a few of my least favourites:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Moreover</strong> - Native speakers hardly ever use this word, and students tend to use it wrongly. Just use 'furthermore' or 'also'.</li>
<li><strong>Demerits</strong> - It's ok to talk about the 'merits' of something, but the word 'demerits' seems unnatural. Just use 'disadvantages' or 'drawbacks'.</li>
<li><strong>Hence / Thusly</strong> - These words sound too formal and old-fashioned. Just use 'therefore' or 'as a result'.</li>
</ul>

	<p>
				<p>People sometimes ask me to teach them "the language for pie charts" or "the language for tables". I tell them that they already know it. The language for the following 4 types of chart is <em><strong>the same</strong></em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Line graphs</li>
<li>Bar charts</li>
<li>Pie charts</li>
<li>Tables</li>
</ul>
<p>These 4 types of chart all show the same thing: numbers. You can usually take the same set of numbers and present them in either of these 4 ways. The language you use to describe them will not change.</p>
<p>So what type of language are you going to use? You need to be able to 1) describe numbers 2) compare different numbers 3) describe changes in numbers (increase, decrease etc.). Easy!</p>

But you need to notice your mistakes before you can learn from them.</p>
<p>Here are some tips about noticing and learning from mistakes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The most obvious strategy is to get someone (e.g. a teacher) to check your written work and correct your mistakes.</li>
<li>Before your teacher checks your work, did you check it carefully yourself?</li>
<li>Study your teacher's corrections, and make sure you understand what you did wrong.</li>
<li>Pay special attention to any repeated mistakes that you make.</li>
<li>If you have a one-to-one teacher, you could also ask him or her to listen for mistakes that you make when speaking.</li>
<li>Try recording yourself. Listen to the recording, and transcribe it. Analyse what you said carefully and ask someone to check it.</li>

	<p>
				<p>Here are my answers to some questions about writing task 1:</p>
<p><em><strong>1) Can I start my introduction like this: "It is on a line graph playing out over a 60 year time period that one sees..."?</strong></em></p>
<p>No. That sentence looks very strange to me as a native speaker, and it won't impress the examiner. Just stick to the simple approach that I recommend in my task 1 lessons here on the website.</p>
<p><em><strong>2) What will happen if my overview paragraph is different from what the examiner would write for an overview?</strong></em></p>
<p>I tell my students to choose two main or general points for their overview (summary) paragraph. There are usually more than two main points to choose from, so don't worry about whether the examiner would choose something different. If your overview sentences summarise the information well, you'll be fine.</p>
<p><em><strong>3) Is writing task 1 less important than task 2?</strong></em></p>
<p>Yes. Task 1 is worth one third of your writing score. Task 2 is worth two thirds.</p>
<p><em><strong>4) Can I write more than 150 words?</strong></em></p>
<p>Yes. There is no maximum word count.</p>
<p><em><strong>5) Is every word counted, even words like "a"?</strong></em></p>
<p>Yes. All words are counted, even small words like "a" and "of".</p>

				<p>Some students learn 10 different ways to write the word "shows" (e.g. the graph shows). They find words like depicts, indicates, reveals, displays, exhibits etc. But none of these words are really appropriate for the kind of essay we are writing.</p>
<p>I advise my students to keep it simple and avoid making mistakes. Just learn one or two different ways to write the same thing. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>shows = illustrates / compares</li>
<li>graph = line graph</li>
<li>chart = bar chart / pie chart</li>
<li>the number of = the figure for</li>

	<p>
				<p>Probably the most important skill for task 1 is to be able to describe numbers correctly. Look at the table below.</p>
<p><a href="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c01538e93bb23970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Picture 1" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c01538e93bb23970b" src="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c01538e93bb23970b-400wi" style="width: 380px;" title="Picture 1"></a></p>
<p>It's useful to think about how to start your sentences. For example, here are some sentences about the year 1970:</p>
<p>1) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">60 million tonnes</span> of goods were transported by road.<br>2) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The amount of goods</span> transported by road totalled 60 million tonnes.<br>3) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Road vehicles</span> were used to transport 60 million tonnes of goods.</p>
<p>You should notice that it's much easier to begin with the number (sentence 1). This is how I usually prefer to write sentences for task 1.</p>
<p>Number 2 is good, but you might find that you repeat "the amount of goods" too many times if you only use this type of sentence.</p>
<p>Number 3 is the most difficult. You can't say "Road was used", so you have to add the word "vehicles". Most students make a mistake here.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Have you ever tried writing several different introductions for the same question? It's a useful exercise. Take this question for example:</p>
<p><em><strong>The table below shows the proportion of different categories of families living in poverty in Australia in 1999.</strong></em></p>

<p style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Cambridge IELTS 4, page 31)</span></p>
<p>Here are 3 introductions that paraphrase the question in different ways. Notice that I sometimes use words from the table to help me.</p>
<p>1) The chart compares percentages of Australians from six different family types who were classed as poor in 1999.</p>
<p>2) The table gives information about poverty rates among six types of household in Australia in the year 1999.</p>

<p>The key is to write clear English, answer the question, and try to include some good vocabulary related to the topic. Forget completely about the other students, and forget about trying to use strange words or phrases.</p>

<p>The bar chart compares twelve countries in terms of the overall number of medals that they have won at the Olympic Games.</p>
<p>It is clear that the USA is by far the most successful Olympic medal winning nation. It is also noticeable that the figures for gold, silver and bronze medals won by any particular country tend to be fairly similar.</p>
<p>The USA has won a total of around 2,300 Olympic medals, including approximately 900 gold medals, 750 silver and 650 bronze. In second place on the all-time medals chart is the Soviet Union, with just over 1,000 medals. Again, the number of gold medals won by this country is slightly higher than the number of silver or bronze medals.</p>
<p>Only four other countries - the UK, France, Germany and Italy - have won more than 500 Olympic medals, all with similar proportions of each medal colour. Apart from the USA and the Soviet Union, China is the only other country with a noticeably higher proportion of gold medals (about 200) compared to silver and bronze (about 100 each).</p>

	<p>
				<p>Students often wonder why their scores fluctuate, especially in the writing and speaking tests. One reason could be that they don't have a method; they approach the exam in a different way every time.</p>
<p>You can only measure your progress if you use the same method every time you take the test. If you always approach the exam in the same way, you will know when you have done well or badly, and if your scores go up or down, you will probably know why.</p>

				<p>Last week I asked why a 'stacked' bar chart was chosen to illustrate the information in the figure below. The answer is that each stacked bar shows us 4 pieces of information (number of gold, silver and bronze medals, and the total number). This is surely the clearest way to show so much information on one chart.</p>

	<p>
				<p>It's easy to read something (e.g. a lesson on this site) and think that you understand it. But 'understanding' is not the same as 'using'.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Can you really USE everything that you have read?<br>Can you use it correctly, without any mistakes?</strong></p>
<p>Look again at yesterday's lesson about 'lead to'. I'm sure you understand these words, but not many students are able to use them accurately. This is important because it could make the difference between a band 6 and a band 7.</p>
<p>Try to think about these steps when you are studying:</p>
<ol>
<li>Understanding a word is only the first step (e.g. 'lead to' means 'cause')</li>
<li>The next step is seeing how words are used (e.g. 'lead to + noun')</li>
<li>Try to use what you have learnt</li>
<li>Ask a teacher to correct your work</li>
<li>Learn from your mistakes</li>

	<p>
				<p>Students often make mistakes when using 'lead to' in their writing. What's the problem with these sentences?</p>
<ol>
<li>Consumerism can lead to increase the economy.</li>
<li>Tourism can lead to destroy natural habitats.</li>
<li>A competitive atmosphere in lessons leads to motivate students.</li>
</ol>
<p>The problem is that we need a <strong>noun or noun phrase after 'lead to'</strong>, not a verb.</p>
<p>So, here are some some ways that you could rewrite the sentences:</p>
<ol>
<li>Consumerism can lead to a more successful economy.</li>
<li>Tourism can lead to the destruction of natural habitats.</li>
<li>A competitive atmosphere in lessons motivates students.</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice that in sentence 3 it is better to keep the verb 'motivates' and miss out 'leads to'.</p>

<p>

	<p>
				<p>When students are stuck on band 6.5 in writing, they often think that they need a new technique, a new book or some new advice. This is wrong!</p>
<p>If you have a 6.5, it means that you are already getting band 7 in 50% of the scoring criteria. For example, you might be getting 7 for task response and 7 for organisation, but 6 for vocabulary and 6 for grammar (examiners can't give half marks in these criteria). Just a small improvement in one area will take you to band 7 overall (e.g. 7,7,7,6 = band 7).</p>
<p>If you are getting band 6.5, your method is fine. Don't change what you're doing; just try to find a small improvement in one area.</p>

<p><em><strong>I tell my students to do the opposite: forget about these things!</strong></em></p>
<p>In my experience, the more you focus on grammar (25% of your score), the less you focus on answering the question well, organising your ideas, and using good vocabulary (75% of your score). Worrying about "difficult grammar" is likely to ruin your answers rather than improve them! Focus on the other 75%.</p>

<p>The table compares the percentages of people using different functions of their mobile phones between 2006 and 2010. </p>
<p>Throughout the period shown, the main reason why people used their mobile phones was to make calls. However, there was a marked increase in the popularity of other mobile phone features, particularly the Internet search feature.</p>
<p>In 2006, 100% of mobile phone owners used their phones to make calls, while the next most popular functions were text messaging (73%) and taking photos (66%). By contrast, less than 20% of owners played games or music on their phones, and there were no figures for users doing Internet searches or recording video.</p>
<p>Over the following 4 years, there was relatively little change in the figures for the top three mobile phone features. However, the percentage of people using their phones to access the Internet jumped to 41% in 2008 and then to 73% in 2010. There was also a significant rise in the use of mobiles to play games and to record video, with figures reaching 41% and 35% respectively in 2010.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em><br>The above essay isn't perfect, but it's still good enough for a band 9. You are not expected to write a masterpiece in only 20 minutes.</p>

<p>The stress of a real exam means that your performance level will probably drop, so you'll need to be <em><strong>more</strong></em> than ready.

<p>The three words would impress the examiner because they fit the description perfectly.

				<p>Is it acceptable to use memorised phrases in the writing and speaking tests? Well, it depends. Take the sentence below as an example. A student asked me whether it can be used at the beginning of a letter (general writing task 1).</p>
<p><em><strong>I hope this letter ﬁnds you well. Sorry I didn't write to you earlier, but I’ve been working ﬂat out since the moment I arrived home.</strong></em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Good use:</span><br>If the question tells you to begin by explaining to your friend why you haven't contacted him/her for a while, then this sentence would be perfect.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bad use:</span><br>However, if the question does <em><strong>not</strong></em> tell you to explain why you didn't write earlier, the sentence is <em><strong>irrelevant</strong></em>.

	<p>
				<p>Here's my full essay for <a href="https://englishwithyeasir.blogspot.co.uk/2013/04/ielts-writing-part-i.html" target="_self">this map question</a>:</p>
<p>The diagrams illustrate some changes to a small island which has been developed for tourism.</p>
<p>It is clear that the island has changed considerably with the introduction of tourism, and six new features can be seen in the second diagram. The main developments are that the island is accessible and visitors have somewhere to stay.</p>
<p>Looking at the maps in more detail, we can see that small huts have been built to accommodate visitors to the island. The other physical structures that have been added are a reception building, in the middle of the island, and a restaurant to the north of the reception. Before these developments, the island was completely bare apart from a few trees.</p>
<p>As well as the buildings mentioned above, the new facilities on the island include a pier, where boats can dock. There is also a short road linking the pier with the reception and restaurant, and footpaths connect the huts. Finally, there is a designated swimming area for tourists off a beach on the western tip of the island.</p>

<p><strong>1. Introduction:</strong> As usual, we can start the essay by paraphrasing the question (rewrite the question in your own words).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question</span><br>The two maps below show an island, before and after the construction of some tourist facilities.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">My introduction</span><br>The diagrams illustrate some changes to a small island which has been developed for tourism.</p>
<p><strong>2. Overview:</strong> For our second paragraph we need to summarise the information in a couple of sentences. When comparing diagrams, we can count the <em><strong>number</strong></em> of changes and look for the main <em><strong>types</strong></em> of changes.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">My overview</span><br>It is clear that the island has changed considerably with the introduction of tourism, and six new features can be seen in the second diagram.

	<p>
				<p>If you have the chance to take some lessons with a private teacher, here are some tips for writing and speaking:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask the teacher to identify your problem areas. Focus on improving those things first.</li>
<li>First, work together on 'big things' like overall essay structure, paragraphs or making sure you answer the question. Only work on 'small things' like grammar mistakes when you have perfected the big things.</li>
<li>Ask your teacher to write a full essay in front of you. Watch how she does it, and ask her to explain what she is thinking as she writes it.</li>
<li>Ask your teacher to mark your essays in front of you, and ask her to explain each correction.</li>
<li>When you practise questions for the speaking test, ask your teacher to play the part of the student. Record her answers and listen to them at home. Try to copy some of the phrases she used.</li>
<li>Practise doing speaking tests, and always ask the teacher for feedback: what did you do that was good, and how could you improve your answers?</li>
</ul>
<p>Private lessons might be more expensive, but they can be hugely beneficial if they are done in the right way.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Many people think they know a word when they understand its meaning. But understanding the meaning is not enough.</p>
<p>You only really know a word when you can <em><strong>use</strong></em> it in a variety of ways and contexts.

	<p>
				<p>Cambridge IELTS book 9 contains a great 'map' question. These questions are quite rare compared to questions containing graphs or charts, but you still need to be prepared for them.</p>
<p>You can see the question on <a href="https://englishwithyeasir.blogspot.co.uk/2013/04/ielts-writing-part-i.html" target="_self">this website</a>, but I would write my essay in a slightly different way to the essay shown on the site.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Students often make mistakes when using these two phrases. To avoid mistakes, follow this simple advice:</p>
<p>- Use <em><strong>For example,</strong></em> at the start of a sentence.<br>- Use <em><strong>such as</strong></em> in the middle of a sentence.</p>
<p>Compare these examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>Children should eat less junk food. <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">For example,</span> they should avoid eating burgers and chips.</li>
<li>Children should avoid eating junk food <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">such as</span> burgers and chips.</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice that 'For example' is followed by a comma and a full sentence. 'Such as' is in the middle of the sentence, followed by two nouns. You can use 'For instance' instead of 'For example'. You can use 'like' instead of 'such as'.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Many students do a lot of testing but not enough preparation. The problem with tests is that you don't learn anything new. You don't improve.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>"To train for a marathon, you don't run a full marathon every day!"</strong></em></p>
<p>The solution is to spend more time preparing. Don't test yourself on a new topic that you have no idea about. Spend some time researching the topic to find good ideas and vocabulary. Then try to write a 'perfect' essay using your research, a dictionary, your teacher to help you etc. Type the essay on a computer, check for spelling and grammar mistakes, re-read it, look at how the paragraphs are organised, highlight the 'band 7 vocabulary'. If I've covered the topic on this website, use my ideas to make 'perfect' paragraphs and ask a teacher to check them.</p>
<p>When you have written a 'perfect' essay, wait for a few days and <em>then test yourself</em> on that topic. Imagine the difference!</p>

	<p>
				<p>When learning a language, grammar rules are useful because they show you how the language <em><strong>normally</strong></em> behaves. For example, you might learn that the word "to" is followed by the infinitive of the verb. The rule tells you that "to have" is correct and "to having" is wrong.</p>
<p>However, you should also be prepared to meet some exceptions to the grammar rules that you learn. For example, students are often confused by phrases like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?hl=en&amp;tab=ww#hl=en&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=%22look+forward+to+having%22&amp;oq=%22look+forward+to+having%22&amp;gs_l=hp.3..0l2j0i22i30l2.3191.10075.0.11539.24.24.0.0.0.1.449.2242.19j3j0j1j1.24.0...0.0...1c.1.12.psy-ab.tpFi40mLAuk&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.46340616,d.d2k&amp;fp=a6e63727a0ee5b33&amp;biw=1042&amp;bih=734" target="_self">'look forward to having'</a> or <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?hl=en&amp;tab=ww#hl=en&amp;output=search&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=%22advantages+to+having%22&amp;oq=%22advantages+to+having%22&amp;gs_l=hp.3..0l4.2452.11029.0.11441.22.22.0.0.0.0.97.1089.22.22.0...0.0...1c.1.12.psy-ab.2G3-3BSYbwk&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.46340616,d.d2k&amp;fp=a6e63727a0ee5b33&amp;biw=1042&amp;bih=734" target="_self">'advantages to having'</a>, both of which are correct.</p>
<p>When you find an exception to a grammar rule, don't get frustrated; consider it an opportunity to expand your knowledge of the language, and perhaps to impress the examiner!</p>

<p><strong>Here's the essay I wrote with my students' help:</strong></p>
<p>The line graph compares figures for daily travel by workers in the UK using three different forms of transport over a period of 60 years.</p>
<p>It is clear that the car is by far the most popular means of transport for UK commuters throughout the period shown. Also, while the numbers of people who use the car and train increase gradually, the number of bus users falls steadily.</p>
<p>In 1970, around 5 million UK commuters travelled by car on a daily basis, while the bus and train were used by about 4 million and 2 million people respectively. In the year 2000, the number of those driving to work rose to 7 million and the number of commuting rail passengers reached 3 million. However, there was a small drop of approximately 0.5 million in the number of bus users.</p>
<p>By 2030, the number of people who commute by car is expected to reach almost 9 million, and the number of train users is also predicted to rise, to nearly 5 million. By contrast, buses are predicted to become a less popular choice, with only 3 million daily users.</p>

<li>The first thing you should notice is that the car was easily the most popular form of transport in each of the years shown on the graph.</li>
<li>Secondly, you could contrast the rising trends for car and train use with the falling trend for bus users.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Here's my overview paragraph describing the two points above:</strong></p>

<p>The answer is no. "Finally" and "at last" <em><strong>are not</strong></em> used in the same way.</p>
<p>Use "finally" in the IELTS writing test when you want to make your final point, or to talk about the final stage in a process e.g. Finally, as well as making life more fun and interesting, new experiences can be good for our physical and mental health.

<p>The answer is no! If you look at the graph, you can see that the whole essay must be about expenditure. In fact, I needed to mention the idea of expenditure eleven times! Does the examiner really expect you to think of eleven synonyms for "expenditure"? Of course not.</p>
<p>It's impossible to avoid repeating some of the key words in writing task 1. Try to add variety where you can (I also used "spending", "spent" and "paid out"), but don't become obsessed with this. The important thing is to describe and compare the data.</p>

	<p>
				<p>To get a band 7, you <em><strong>don't</strong></em> need to learn "big" or "difficult" words. You need to learn how to use words <em><strong>together</strong></em>. You need to use good collocations.</p>
<p>Collocations are groups of words that often go together. For example, collocations like "increase significantly" are used in IELTS Writing Task 1.</p>
<p>Look for collocations in the speaking and writing lessons on this website. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Health topic:</strong> a major cause, poor health, manual jobs, physical activity, outdoor sports.</li>
<li><strong>Writing Task 1:</strong> noticeable feature, significantly higher, a dramatic increase in.</li>
<li><strong>Describe a person:</strong> a major influence, a good role model, inherit traits, set an example, a positive outlook.</li>

	<p>
				<p>I try to give my students good vocabulary ideas to help them write better essays and give better spoken answers. However, some students feel like they are copying or cheating if they use my ideas. They prefer to use a dictionary or rely on what they already know.</p>
<p>My advice is: get your vocabulary ideas from the lessons on this website, from a book, or from your teacher. This is good preparation, not copying or cheating!</p>

<p>The line graph compares average yearly spending by Americans on mobile and landline phone services from 2001 to 2010.</p>
<p>It is clear that spending on landline phones fell steadily over the 10-year period, while mobile phone expenditure rose quickly. The year 2006 marks the point at which expenditure on mobile services overtook that for residential phone services.</p>
<p>In 2001, US consumers spent an average of nearly $700 on residential phone services, compared to only around $200 on cell phone services. Over the following five years, average yearly spending on landlines dropped by nearly $200. By contrast, expenditure on mobiles rose by approximately $300.</p>
<p>In the year 2006, the average American paid out the same amount of money on both types of phone service, spending just over $500 on each. By 2010, expenditure on mobile phones had reached around $750, while the figure for spending on residential services had fallen to just over half this amount.</p>

				<p>To get a good IELTS score, you need to use the kind of language that native speakers might use. This doesn't mean 'difficult words', it means good groups of words (phrases and collocations).</p>
<p>When reading, try to look for phrases that English speakers use. Here's an example paragraph from the <a href="https://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2011/08/web-turns-twenty" target="_self">Economist Magazine</a> with a few useful words and phrases underlined.</p>
<p>It is always a little disconcerting to realise a generation has grown up never knowing what it was like to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">manage without something</span> that is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">taken for granted</span> today. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">A case in point</span>: the World Wide Web (WWW), which celebrated the 20th anniversary of its introduction last Saturday. It is no exaggeration to say that not since the invention of the printing press has a new media technology <span style="text-decoration: underline;">altered the way people think, work and play</span> quite so extensively.

	<p>
				<p>Question 4 in Monday's <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2013/02/ielts-reading-true-false-not-given.html" target="_self">reading lesson</a> caused some problems because many people fell into the trap of 'overthinking' the answer. They were worried about the precise meaning of the word "infants", and whether it meant the same thing as "pre-school age children".</p>
<p>In the reading test, you shouldn't worry about such precise distinctions. It's enough to recognise that both "infants" and "pre-school age children" are very young children. The answer would be 'false' if the question mentioned "teenagers" or "adolescents" - these are definitely not pre-school ages.</p>
<p>Remember that the people who write these questions rely on paraphrasing and synonyms; it wouldn't really test your English if every question contained the exact words from the passage. If the words have basically the same meaning, don't analyse them any further.</p>

<p>The diagram illustrates the various stages in the life of a honey bee. We can see that the complete life cycle lasts between 34 and 36 days. It is also noticeable that there are five main stages in the development of the honey bee, from egg to mature adult insect.</p>
<p>The life cycle of the honey bee begins when the female adult lays an egg; the female typically lays one or two eggs every 3 days. Between 9 and 10 days later, each egg hatches and the immature insect, or nymph, appears.</p>
<p>During the third stage of the life cycle, the nymph grows in size and sheds its skin three times. This moulting first takes place 5 days after the egg hatches, then 7 days later, and again another 9 days later. After a total of 30 to 31 days from the start of the cycle, the young adult honey bee emerges from its final moulting stage, and in the space of only 4 days it reaches full maturity.</p>

				<p>Many students are forced to study for the IELTS test alone. For one reason or another, they can't attend any classes or preparation courses. I started this blog with the aim of helping people in that position.</p>
<p>However, those people often reach the point where they need some direct guidance. They need someone to check their essays or listen to them speak.</p>
<p>If you keep getting the same score in every test that you take, it's probably time to find a teacher who can check your work and help you to become 'unstuck'.</p>

<ol>
<li>Try to develop each bullet point in detail. If you don't say enough for the first two or three points, you'll find yourself with too much time for the last point.</li>
<li>Tell a story! My second point tells the story of how I was given the chair by a friend, and I could probably speak for 2 minutes about this point alone. When you tell a story about something real that happened, you'll find it easy to keep talking. Stories are also interesting for the listener (the examiner).</li>
<li>Add examples. In point 3, you can see that I added an example at the end ("last night I fell asleep in my armchair while I was watching a film"). I could easily take this example and develop it into another short story.</li>
<li>When describing an object, don't forget the simple things like size, colour (I forgot that one!), shape, material, position ("just under my living room window").</li>

	<p>
				<p>Correct or natural use of articles (the, a, an) is probably one of the most difficult things for learners of English to master. For example, why did I write "temperatures are highest" instead of "temperatures are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> highest" in the essay I wrote last week? <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2011/12/ielts-grammar-highest-or-the-highest.html" target="_self">Click here</a> to read an explanation.</p>
<p>There are many other complex 'rules' about article use in English, which grammar books and <a href="http://www.learnenglish.de/grammar/articlestext.htm" target="_self">websites</a> do their best to explain. I also recommend using Google in the way described below.</p>
<p><em><strong>Task:</strong></em> try Googling the phrases "temperatures were highest" and "temperatures were <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> highest" (make sure you put the quotation marks so that Google searches for the whole phrase). Compare the number of search results to see which is more common, then look through the results to find good examples of full sentences for each phrase. You might find that good examples help you more than grammar rules do.</p>

<p>The chart compares average figures for temperature and precipitation over the course of a calendar year in Kolkata.</p>
<p>It is noticeable that monthly figures for precipitation in Kolkata vary considerably, whereas monthly temperatures remain relatively stable. Rainfall is highest from July to August, while temperatures are highest in April and May.</p>
<p>Between the months of January and May, average temperatures in Kolkata rise from their lowest point at around 20°C to a peak of just over 30°C. Average rainfall in the city also rises over the same period, from approximately 20mm of rain in January to 100mm in May.</p>
<p>While temperatures stay roughly the same for the next four months, the amount of rainfall more than doubles between May and June. Figures for precipitation remain above 250mm from June to September, peaking at around 330mm in July. The final three months of the year see a dramatic fall in precipitation, to a low of about 10mm in December, and a steady drop in temperatures back to the January average.</p>

				<p>Students are often worried because they find difficult or confusing IELTS questions on the Internet (especially for writing task 2). My advice is: don't trust questions you find on the Internet. They are often written by students who have remembered them wrongly.</p>
<p>You can definitely trust the Cambridge IELTS books. Cambridge makes the IELTS exam, so you know that the questions in those books are 'real'. They are also clearly written, so you will not be confused about what the question is asking you to do.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Students often worry about repeating the same words in writing task 1. For example, in last week's lesson I repeated the phrase <em><strong>average weekly spending</strong></em> maybe three times. Is this a big problem?</p>
<p>No! Repeating a key word or phrase a few times is not a problem; sometimes it is necessary to show that you are consistently talking about the same thing. If you try to use too much variety, there is a danger that you will confuse the reader or write something that does not mean what you want it to mean.</p>
<p>It's fine to either repeat the key words or make small changes. Look at these examples of small changes I made to the phrase <em><strong>average weekly spending</strong></em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>spent on average</li>
<li>average expenditure</li>
<li>weekly spending figures</li>
<li>levels of spending</li>

<p><strong>Analysis:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Notice that I didn't include any specific numbers. Save the details for later.</li>
<li>The first sentence describes the "big picture". The first thing I did was look at <em><strong>all 4 lines and the whole period</strong></em>. I noticed that there was an overall trend towards people having more cars (the word 'ownership' came from the question). Most students tend to miss this kind of general observation.</li>

<li>If there is a 2 band difference between your writing and speaking scores, they are usually double-checked automatically, so a re-mark probably won't help.</li>
<li>A re-mark might be worth trying if you only need an extra half band in speaking or writing (e.g. if you have 6.5 and need 7).</li>
<li>Remember that it can take up to 8 weeks to get your test re-marked. It might be faster to resit the test.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em><br>If you have had a test re-marked, please tell us what happened. It would be interesting to know how many people's scores went up.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here's my full essay for the  <span class="asset  asset-generic at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c016768977e8b970b"><a href="http://ielts-simon.com/files/t1-age-group-bar-charts-1.pdf">'age group bar charts'</a></span> question:</p>
<p>The bar charts compare students of different ages in terms of why they are studying and whether they are supported by an employer.</p>
<p>It is clear that the proportion of students who study for career purposes is far higher among the younger age groups, while the oldest students are more likely to study for interest. Employer support is more commonly given to younger students.</p>
<p>Around 80% of students aged under 26 study to further their careers, whereas only 10% study purely out of interest. The gap between these two proportions narrows as students get older, and the figures for those in their forties are the same, at about 40%. Students aged over 49 overwhelmingly study for interest (70%) rather than for professional reasons (less than 20%).</p>
<p>Just over 60% of students aged under 26 are supported by their employers. By contrast, the 30-39 age group is the most self-sufficient, with only 30% being given time off and help with fees. The figures rise slightly for students in their forties and for those aged 50 or more.</p>

<p><em><strong>3 sentences about the first chart:</strong></em></p>
<ol>
<li>Compare the percentages for students under 26.</li>
<li>Mention the overall trend as students get older, and that the proportions are the same for the 40-49 age group.</li>

	<p>
				<p>A few people have asked about the question on page 52 of Cambridge IELTS 5. It shows two bar charts with age groups.  <span class="asset  asset-generic at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c017616236671970c"><a href="http://ielts-simon.com/files/bar-charts-1.pdf">Click here</a></span> to see the question.</p>
<p>As usual, I recommend writing 4 paragraphs:</p>
<ol>
<li>A quick introduction to say what the charts show.</li>
<li>An overview of the main features - one sentence for each chart.</li>
<li>Describe the first chart in detail.</li>
<li>Describe the second chart in detail.</li>
</ol>
<p><em><strong>Here's an example introduction and overview:</strong></em></p>
<p>The first bar chart compares students of different ages in terms of why they are studying their chosen courses, and the second chart compares the same age groups in terms of the help they require at work.</p>
<p>It is clear that the proportion of people who study for career purposes is far higher among the younger age groups, and decreases steadily with age. The need for employer support also decreases with age, but only up to the point when employees enter their forties.</p>

	<p>
				<p>The easiest way to start your Task 1 essay is by paraphrasing the question. Paraphrasing means writing something in a different way (using your own words).</p>
<p><em><strong>Here are some simple changes you can make:</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>graph = line graph</li>
<li>chart = bar chart</li>
<li>diagram = figure</li>
<li>shows = illustrates (or 'compares' if the graph is comparing)</li>
<li>proportion = percentage</li>
<li>information = data</li>
<li>the number of = the figure for</li>
<li>the proportion of = the figure for</li>
<li>people in the USA = Americans</li>
<li>from 1999 to 2009 = between 1999 and 2009</li>
<li>from 1999 to 2009 = over a period of 10 years</li>
<li>how to produce = the process of producing</li>
<li>in three countries = in the UK, France and Spain (i.e. name the countries)</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Tip:</strong></em><br>"The figure for / figures for" is a great phrase that not many people use (e.g. the graph shows figures for unemployment in three countries).</p>

				<p><em><strong>The chart below shows numbers of incidents and injuries per 100 million passenger miles travelled (PMT) by transportation type in 2002.</strong></em></p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c0163062e1ad2970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="6a0120a5bb05d8970c0168ebf02f2b970c-800wi" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c0163062e1ad2970d" src="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c0163062e1ad2970d-800wi" title="6a0120a5bb05d8970c0168ebf02f2b970c-800wi"></a></p>
<p>The bar chart compares the number of incidents and injuries for every 100 million passenger miles travelled on five different types of public transport in 2002.</p>
<p>It is clear that the most incidents and injuries took place on demand-response vehicles. By contrast, commuter rail services recorded by far the lowest figures.</p>
<p>A total of 225 incidents and 173 injuries, per 100 million passenger miles travelled, took place on demand-response transport services. These figures were nearly three times as high as those for the second highest category, bus services. There were 76 incidents and 66 people were injured on buses.</p>
<p>Rail services experienced fewer problems. The number of incidents on light rail trains equalled the figure recorded for buses, but there were significantly fewer injuries, at only 39. Heavy rail services saw lower numbers of such events than light rail services, but commuter rail passengers were even less likely to experience problems. In fact, only 20 incidents and 17 injuries occurred on commuter trains.</p>
<p>(165 words, band 9)</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em><br>Don't worry about the repetition of "incidents and injuries" in this essay. There are no perfect synonyms for these words, although I managed to use "problems" and "such events" later in the essay. The most important thing is to describe the data clearly and make some good comparisons.</p>

<p><em>"It's not really about what students do inside the classroom. The best students are always the ones that do the most outside the classroom: for example, the ones that go online after a lesson to search for more information, or to look for different ways to understand a topic or solve a problem."</em></p>

	<p>
				<p>Last week we saw that there are two types of bar chart:<br>1. those that show changes over time<br>2. those that compare different items</p>
<p>The important thing to remember about the second type is that you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">can't</span> describe increases and decreases. Let's look at this type in more detail.</p>
<p><em><strong>The chart below shows numbers of incidents and injuries per 100 million passenger miles travelled (PMT) by transportation type in 2002.</strong></em></p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c0168ebf02f2b970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="6a0120a5bb05d8970c0168ebb8043d970c-800wi" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c0168ebf02f2b970c" src="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c0168ebf02f2b970c-800wi" title="6a0120a5bb05d8970c0168ebb8043d970c-800wi"></a></p>
<p>Here's my advice for a 4-paragraph essay:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Introduction</span>: Explain what the chart shows by paraphrasing the question.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Overview</span>: Look for two main things - in this case, we could mention the highest item and the fact that there were more incidents than injuries for all five transport types. You don't need to mention any numbers at this point.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Details</span>: I'd probably group together the two highest items (demand response and bus) in this paragraph. Remember that you can't talk about an increase or decrease; you can only compare the numbers.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Details</span>: I'd group the three types of rail transport together for this paragraph. Write some nice comparison sentences!</li>
</ol>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em><br>You don't need to know what 'demand-response' transport is (it's an American term which I've never used), but <a href="http://www.cflhd.gov/ttoolkit/flt/FactSheets/Transit/DEMAND%20RESPONSIVE.htm" target="_self">click here</a> if you want to know.</p>

<p>My answer to the above questions is <em><strong>no</strong></em>. If you write "ascend" or "portray" in writing task 1, it will seem strange to the examiner. Those words are not appropriate for a graph or chart description.</p>
<p>Remember: the aim of the IELTS test is <em><strong>not</strong></em> to find 'original' writers; it is to see whether you can express your ideas clearly, accurately, and in a certain amount of detail.

<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c01676603be91970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="6a0120a5bb05d8970c0168eab4e722970c-500wi" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c01676603be91970b" src="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c01676603be91970b-500wi" title="6a0120a5bb05d8970c0168eab4e722970c-500wi"></a></p>
<p>Here are my answers to last week's questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>It's fine to repeat the word 'waste' because there isn't really an ideal synonym ('rubbish' and 'garbage' have a more limited meaning). However, we can vary our sentences by writing things like 'waste output', 'waste materials' or 'the waste that was produced'.</li>
<li>The most noticeable feature must be that the US produced by far the most waste in all 3 years. Use this idea in you 'overview' paragraph.</li>
<li>The general trend is that waste production rose in every country apart from Korea. This could be your second 'overview' idea.</li>
<li>I would write one main paragraph comparing the 3 countries with the highest figures (US, Japan, Korea), and a separate paragraph about Ireland, Poland and Portugal. Try to use some 'comparing' language when describing the countries (e.g. while, whereas, by contrast) and some 'trend' language when describing the years (e.g. increased, rose, fell).</li>

	<p>
				<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_self">Amazon</a> website is a great place to read descriptions and reviews of books, films and many other products. Here are a few reasons why this might be useful:</p>

	<p>
				<p>One problem for students is that different teachers, books and websites teach different techniques. Students get confused.</p>
<p>My advice is to stop looking for the magic technique; it doesn't exist. There is no best book or website, and there are many different ways to write a good essay.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>You just need one way, one technique that you like. </strong></p>
<p>If you look at my lessons, you will see that I have "my technique" for each part of the exam (feel free to use my techniques if you like them). For example, I always write introductions in the same way, and I always start paragraphs with a topic sentence.</p>
<p>Because of the time limit in the exam, you NEED to know what you're going to do. You need to practise ONE way of working. Don't get confused by having too many options.</p>

	<p>
				<p>A student sent me the following question from a recent IELTS test:</p>
<p><em><strong>The table below shows the amount of waste production (in millions of tonnes) in six different countries in three different years over a twenty-year period.</strong></em></p>

<p>A few things to consider before you write your essay:</p>
<ol>
<li>Can you think of a few alternative ways to write "waste production"?</li>
<li>What is the most noticeable feature of the table?</li>
<li>Is there a general trend over the period of time shown?</li>

	<p>
				<p>Students often make simple mistakes with singular and plural forms, especially in Writing Task 1. The problem is that the words used on graphs, charts and tables are usually singular.</p>
<p>So, the labels on a chart could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>single parent</li>
<li>graduate</li>
<li>only child</li>
<li>laptop computer</li>
</ul>
<p>But when you write a sentence, you might need to use a plural:</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of single parent<span style="text-decoration: underline;">s</span> increased.</li>
<li>In 1999 nearly 55% of graduate<span style="text-decoration: underline;">s</span> were female.</li>
<li>The UK has the highest number of only child<span style="text-decoration: underline;">ren</span>.</li>
<li>More laptop computer<span style="text-decoration: underline;">s</span> were sold in the UK than any other country.</li>

	<p>
				<p>Here are some simple rules to help you with punctuation for IELTS writing:</p>
<p><strong>Full stops</strong><br>Full stops are very important. Put a clear full stop at the end of each sentence, and then begin the next sentence with a capital letter. If you don't do this, you will get a low score.</p>
<p><strong>Commas</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>When you start a sentence with these words, put a comma after them:<br>Nowadays, Recently, Firstly, Secondly, Finally, Furthermore, In addition, Also, However, By contrast, On the other hand, In my opinion,...</li>
<li>We use commas in lists:<br>e.g. This problem affects individuals, communities and society in general.</li>
<li>We don't usually put a comma after the word "that":<br>e.g. It is clear that the rate of immigration increased.</li>
<li>Don't worry about other uses of commas. The use of a comma is often optional in other situations.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Apostrophes</strong><br>Avoid contractions in IELTS writing. Use "do not" instead of "don't".<br>You may sometimes need to show possession e.g. the government's decision.</p>
<p><strong>Other punctuation</strong><br>You don't really need to use any other punctuation in IELTS writing.<br>My advice is to avoid trying to use colons and semicolons.</p>

<li><strong>Selecting key information</strong> - first year (1940), middle years (1990, early 2000s), end of period (2030 to 2040)</li>
<li><strong>Comparing</strong> - in each country, most dramatic, and, compared to, by contrast, while, slightly lower, respectively (analyse my sentences to learn how to use these words correctly)</li>

				<p><em><strong>Here's my full essay for last week's <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2012/03/ielts-writing-task-1-graph-showing-future-years.html" target="_self">line graph question</a>:</strong></em></p>
<p>The line graph compares the percentage of people aged 65 or more in three countries over a period of 100 years.</p>
<p>It is clear that the proportion of elderly people increases in each country between 1940 and 2040. Japan is expected to see the most dramatic changes in its elderly population.</p>
<p>In 1940, around 9% of Americans were aged 65 or over, compared to about 7% of Swedish people and 5% of Japanese people. The proportions of elderly people in the USA and Sweden rose gradually over the next 50 years, reaching just under 15% in 1990. By contrast, the figures for Japan remained below 5% until the early 2000s.</p>
<p>Looking into the future, a sudden increase in the percentage of elderly people is predicted for Japan, with a jump of over 15% in just 10 years from 2030 to 2040. By 2040, it is thought that around 27% of the Japanese population will be 65 years old or more, while the figures for Sweden and the USA will be slightly lower, at about 25% and 23% respectively.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Several students have asked me about the following question from Cambridge IELTS book 5 (page 29).</p>
<p><em><strong>The graph below shows the proportion of the population aged 65 and over between 1940 and 2040 in three different countries.</strong></em></p>
<p><a href="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c0168e8c9f264970c-pi" style="display: inline;"> </a><a href="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c016302d4a2b7970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Screen Shot 2012-03-14 at 15.53.22" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c016302d4a2b7970d" src="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c016302d4a2b7970d-400wi" style="width: 400px;" title="Screen Shot 2012-03-14 at 15.53.22"></a></p>
<p>Here are the steps I would follow to write my essay:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Introduction:</strong> write one sentence to introduce what the graph shows. Just paraphrase the question statement (i.e. change a few words).</li>
<li><strong>Summary:</strong> describe 2 main things e.g. the overall trend for all 3 countries, and the biggest change that you can see.</li>
<li><strong>Details:</strong> compare all 3 countries in 1940, then in 1990.</li>
<li><strong>Details:</strong> describe the dramatic increase predicted for Japan, and compare all 3 countries in 2040.</li>
</ol>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em><br>Try writing some essay plans like the one above. Planning makes you think about selecting and organising, so it's a useful skill to practise (even if you don't do a plan in your exam).</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here are some tips for writing about 2 charts, graphs or tables:</p>
<p><strong>1. Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Write one sentence, but introduce each chart separately e.g. "The first bar chart shows..., and the second chart illustrates..."</p>
<p><strong>2. Summary of main points</strong></p>
<p>Write 2 sentences. If the information in the charts is not connected, find one main point or general trend for each chart. If the charts are connected, try to make comparisons.</p>
<p><strong>3. Main body paragraphs</strong></p>
<p>If the 2 charts are completely different (e.g. a graph and a table), write a separate paragraph about each.</p>
<p>If the charts are the same, and show the same information (e.g. 2 pie charts), don't describe them separately; the examiner will want to see comparisons. In this case, you could write one paragraph describing all of the information, but I still prefer to write 2 paragraphs because it makes the essay look more organised.</p>

<li>We use "the" when there is a noun after the adjective e.g. the highest number, the highest proportion.</li>

<p><em><strong>The table below gives information on consumer spending on different items in five different countries in 2002.</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Percentage of national consumer expenditure by category - 2002</p>
<p><a href="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c0148c78b1eaf970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Picture 2" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c0148c78b1eaf970c image-full" src="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c0148c78b1eaf970c-800wi" title="Picture 2"></a></p>
<p>The table shows percentages of consumer expenditure for three categories of products and services in five countries in 2002.</p>
<p>It is clear that the largest proportion of consumer spending in each country went on food, drinks and tobacco. On the other hand, the leisure/education category has the lowest percentages in the table.</p>
<p>Out of the five countries, consumer spending on food, drinks and tobacco was noticeably higher in Turkey, at 32.14%, and Ireland, at nearly 29%. The proportion of spending on leisure and education was also highest in Turkey, at 4.35%, while expenditure on clothing and footwear was significantly higher in Italy, at 9%, than in any of the other countries.</p>
<p>It can be seen that Sweden had the lowest percentages of national consumer expenditure for food/drinks/tobacco and for clothing/footwear, at nearly 16% and just over 5% respectively. Spain had slightly higher figures for these categories, but the lowest figure for leisure/education, at only 1.98%.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Yesterday I said that linking words don't help your vocabulary score, and that you need to use 'topic specific' vocabulary if you want a high score.</p>
<p>But what is 'topic specific' vocabulary?</p>
<p>The answer is: vocabulary that you would probably only use for one particular essay question. For example, I used this vocabulary in a lesson last week:</p>
<p>- impoverished or disadvantaged<br>- prioritise local charity<br>- those who live beyond our national borders<br>- curable diseases<br>- paying for vaccines that already exist</p>
<p>You might be able to adapt these phrases to a different topic, but it wouldn't be easy; they are quite specific to the particular question in <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2011/12/ielts-writing-task-2-help-essay.html" target="_self">this lesson</a>.

	<p>
				<p>Today I'm going to explain my thinking process when I answer an IELTS Writing Task 1 question. We'll use this question (Cambridge IELTS 7, page 30):</p>
<p><em><strong>The table below gives information on consumer spending on different items in five different countries in 2002.</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Percentage of national consumer expenditure by category - 2002</p>
<p><a href="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c0148c78b1b4a970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Picture 2" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c0148c78b1b4a970c image-full" src="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c0148c78b1b4a970c-800wi" title="Picture 2"></a></p>
<p>Before I worry about what language to use, it's really important to understand the information, and decide how to organise it. This is what I'm thinking:</p>
<ol>
<li>I know that I can write a short introduction by paraphrasing the question.</li>
<li>I look for an overall trend. I can see that the food/drinks/tobacco category has the highest percentages, and leisure/education has the lowest.</li>
<li>Now I want to write two main body paragraphs. I need to select something to say about each country. Remember, there is no rule about what information you select; everyone will do this differently.</li>
<li>I look for the highest figures in each category: I can see that Turkey has the highest figure for food/drinks/tobacco AND for education/leisure. Italy has the highest figure for clothing/footwear.</li>
<li>So, I'll write a paragraph about Turkey and Italy.</li>
<li>My final paragraph needs to talk about Ireland, Spain and Sweden.</li>
<li>Maybe I'll point out that Ireland has a high figure for the first category, Spain has the lowest figure for education/leisure, and Sweden has the lowest figures for the first AND second categories.</li>
<li>I don't need a conclusion because I have already mentioned a general trend in point 2.</li>

	<p>
				<p>Last week I wrote a plan for this question. Now I've added my full essay below.</p>
<p><em><strong>The graph and table below give information about water use worldwide and water consumption in two different countries.</strong></em></p>
<p><a href="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c0153940d0aee970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="6a0120a5bb05d8970c0162fd08ae84970d-500wi" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c0153940d0aee970b" src="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c0153940d0aee970b-500wi" title="6a0120a5bb05d8970c0162fd08ae84970d-500wi"></a></p>
<p>The charts compare the amount of water used for agriculture, industry and homes around the world, and water use in Brazil and the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
<p>It is clear that global water needs rose significantly between 1900 and 2000, and that agriculture accounted for the largest proportion of water used. We can also see that water consumption was considerably higher in Brazil than in the Congo.</p>
<p>In 1900, around 500km³ of water was used by the agriculture sector worldwide. The figures for industrial and domestic water consumption stood at around one fifth of that amount. By 2000, global water use for agriculture had increased to around 3000km³, industrial water use had risen to just under half that amount, and domestic consumption had reached approximately 500km³.</p>
<p>In the year 2000, the populations of Brazil and the Congo were 176 million and 5.2 million respectively. Water consumption per person in Brazil, at 359m³, was much higher than that in the Congo, at only 8m³, and this could be explained by the fact that Brazil had 265 times more irrigated land.</p>

				<p>Somebody asked me about the difference between these 4 words (for IELTS writing task 1). I'll try to explain some basic ways to use them.</p>
<p><strong>number</strong><br>- Use "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">the number of</span> + plural noun" e.g. the number of visitors.<br>- Don't use it to describe percentages or uncountable nouns e.g. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">money</span>.</p>
<p><strong>amount</strong><br>- Use "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">the amount of</span> + uncountable noun" e.g. the amount of money.<br>- Don't use it with countable nouns e.g. the amount of <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">person</span>/<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">people</span>.</p>
<p><strong>proportion</strong><br>- Only use this to describe percentages (not numbers).<br>- Use "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">the proportion of</span> + plural noun" e.g. the proportion of people.</p>
<p><strong>figure</strong><br>- Use "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">the figure for</span> + plural noun" e.g. the figure for visitors to the UK.<br>- Use it with uncountable nouns e.g. the figure for unemployment.<br>- Use it with countries e.g. the figure for Canada.<br>- Use it with percentages e.g. the figure (for...) rose to 10%.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Some students (both in my classes and online) find it hard to believe that all of my essays are band 9. They are under the impression that you need to use "difficult" language to get a high score. This is how I respond:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is "difficult" language? Language is not mathematics; anyone can learn and understand a word or phrase.</li>
<li>The most difficult thing is using words together correctly and naturally. Small words like articles and prepositions cause the most problems.</li>
<li>If an essay has no grammar mistakes and a mix of long and short sentences, it's almost certain that it will get band 9 for grammar.</li>
<li>If ideas are explained and developed in a clear, logical way, you will get a high score for coherence and cohesion.</li>
<li>If you try to make your writing over-complicated, it will seem forced and unnatural.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember: if an essay is difficult to read, it's probably badly written. Good writing is surprisingly easy to read, and the arguments are easy to follow.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Students often don't notice when a teacher corrects their mistakes.</p>
<p>Look at this example of a conversation between a teacher and a student:</p>
<p>Teacher: <em>How long have you been living in Manchester?</em><br>Student: <em>I came here before one month?</em><br>Teacher: <em>One month ago?</em><br>Student: <em>Yes, before one month.</em></p>
<p>The student doesn't notice that the teacher is correcting a mistake. In English we don't say "before one month", we say "one month ago".</p>
<p>When a teacher repeats something that you said in a different way, you probably made a mistake. Listen carefully, and try to notice mistakes and corrections.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here's my full essay for the pie charts in last week's lesson. I've made the last two paragraphs into a gap-fill exercise to focus your attention on some good ways to describe numbers.</p>
<p><em><strong>Fill the gaps with these words:</strong></em><br><em><strong>constitutes, drops, amount, fifth, higher, make, one, relative, figure, up</strong></em></p>
<p>The pie charts compare the proportion of carbohydrates, protein and fat in three different diets, namely an average diet, a healthy diet, and a healthy diet for sport.</p>
<p>It is noticeable that sportspeople require a diet comprising a significantly higher proportion of carbohydrates than an average diet or a healthy diet. The average diet contains the lowest percentage of carbohydrates but the highest proportion of protein.</p>
<p>Carbohydrates ______ ______ 60% of the healthy diet for sport. This is 10% ______ than the proportion of carbohydrates in a normal healthy diet, and 20% more than the proportion in an average diet. On the other hand, people who eat an average diet consume a greater ______ ______ of protein (40%) than those who eat a healthy diet (30%) and sportspeople (25%).</p>
<p>The third compound shown in the charts is fat. Fat ______ exactly ______ ______ of both the average diet and the healthy diet, but the ______ ______ to only 15% for the healthy sports diet.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Last week I said that you need to do 3 things to write a task 1 essay: introduce, summarise, and describe details. Today I'll look at the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">introduction</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">summary</span> for the pie charts below.</p>
<p><a href="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c015392ea56f7970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="6a0120a5bb05d8970c015392bbf8e9970b-800wi" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c015392ea56f7970b" src="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c015392ea56f7970b-800wi" title="6a0120a5bb05d8970c015392bbf8e9970b-800wi"></a></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Introduction</span> - just say what the pie charts show:</p>
<p><em>The pie charts compare the proportion of carbohydrates, protein and fat in three different diets, namely an average diet, a healthy diet, and a healthy diet for sport.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> Don't try to 'show off' in your introduction. Just use 'show', 'compare' or 'illustrate'; don't use words like 'depict' or 'indicate'.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Summary</span> - write 2 sentences about the main/general points:</p>
<p><em>It is noticeable that sportspeople require a diet comprising a significantly higher proportion of carbohydrates than an average diet or a healthy diet. The average diet contains the lowest percentage of carbohydrates but the highest proportion of protein.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> There is no 'right' way to choose your main/general points. Just choose the two things that you notice first. I try to avoid specific numbers in my summaries - save numbers for the 'details' paragraphs. We'll look at those next week.</p>

				<p>Here are some mistakes that can really affect your IELTS score:</p>
<ol>
<li>Writing less than 150 or 250 words. My advice: count how many words you write, on average, per line. If you write about 10 words per line, make sure that you write more than 25 lines for writing task 2.</li>
<li>Not separating paragraphs. Your score will immediately drop if you don't separate paragraphs clearly. My advice: leave a full line between paragraphs.</li>
<li>Not answering the question (writing and speaking). My advice: in the writing exam, keep checking the question to make sure you are answering it fully. In the speaking exam, answer the question directly, then explain your answer.</li>
<li>Not finishing the reading test. My advice: you must get to the end of the test paper. If you get stuck on a difficult question, miss it out and return to it later.</li>
<li>Making spelling mistakes in the listening test. My advice: if you have a spelling problem, you must keep a list of your mistakes and learn the correct spellings by heart. Test yourself every day.</li>

				<p>Tables seem difficult when they contain a lot of numbers. Here's some advice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Try to write 4 paragraphs - introduction, summary of main points, 2 detail paragraphs.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Before you start writing, highlight some key numbers. Choose the biggest number in each category in the table (i.e. in each column and row). If the table shows years, look for the biggest changes in numbers over the time period. You could also mention the smallest numbers, but you can ignore 'middle' numbers (neither biggest nor smallest).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>For your summary paragraph, try to compare whole categories (columns or rows) rather than individual 'cells' in the table. If you can't compare whole categories, compare the biggest and smallest number. Write 2 sentences for the summary.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In your two 'details' paragraphs, never describe each category (column or row) separately. The examiner wants to see comparisons. Try to organise the numbers you highlighted into 2 groups - one for each paragraph (e.g. highest numbers for all categories together, and lowest numbers together).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Describe / compare the numbers you highlighted - include at least 3 numbers in each paragraph. </li>

<p>The bar chart compares the cost of an average house in five major cities over a period of 13 years from 1989.</p>
<p>We can see that house prices fell overall between 1990 and 1995, but most of the cities saw rising prices between 1996 and 2002. London experienced by far the greatest changes in house prices over the 13-year period.</p>
<p>Over the 5 years after 1989, the cost of average homes in Tokyo and London dropped by around 7%, while New York house prices went down by 5%. By contrast, prices rose by approximately 2% in both Madrid and Frankfurt.</p>
<p>Between 1996 and 2002, London house prices jumped to around 12% above the 1989 average. Homebuyers in New York also had to pay significantly more, with prices rising to 5% above the 1989 average, but homes in Tokyo remained cheaper than they were in 1989. The cost of an average home in Madrid rose by a further 2%, while prices in Frankfurt remained stable.</p>

				<p>The question below comes from Cambridge IELTS book 7. Students tend to find this question difficult, but last week's lesson about house prices might help.</p>

<p>Some advice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduction: paraphrase the question.</li>
<li>Summary: compare the two periods (prices fell overall from 1990-95, but rose from 1996-2002), and mention that London prices changed the most.</li>
<li>Details: write one paragraph about each period.</li>

				<p>If you want to learn how to describe trends (increase, decrease etc.), search for some news about house prices.</p>
<p><em><strong>Here's part of a news article I found about UK house prices:</strong></em></p>
<p>There was seemingly good news for UK home owners when Halifax announced house prices had risen by 0.3% in July 2011, boosting the average value of a property to £163,981. Halifax also noted that prices were 0.5% higher over the three months from May to July than in the previous three months.</p>
<p>But is it time to celebrate the renaissance of the housing market? Even Halifax’s index shows that over the preceding 12-month period, prices actually fell by 2.6%. Despite the price increases seen in recent months, we are finding that the average price of a property remains just under 13% below its peak in 2007.</p>
<p><em><strong>Try to answer the questions below. Write a full sentence for each answer.</strong></em></p>

<li>What happened to UK house prices in July 2011?</li>

	<p>
				<p>Process diagrams show how something is done or made. They always show steps/stages. Here's some advice about how to describe them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Try to write 4 paragraphs - introduction, summary of main points, 2 detail paragraphs.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Write the introduction by paraphrasing the question (rewrite it by changing some of the words).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>For your summary, first say how many steps there are in the process. Then say where/how the process begins and ends (look at the first and last stages).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In paragraphs 3 and 4, describe the process step by step. Include the first and last steps that you mentioned in the summary, but try to describe them in more detail or in a different way.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You could describe the steps in one paragraph, but it looks more organised if you break the description into two paragraphs. Just start paragraph 4 somewhere in the middle of the process.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Mention every stage in the process.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Use 'sequencing' language e.g. at the first / second / following / final stage of the process, next, after that, then, finally etc.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Times (e.g. past dates) are not usually shown, so use the present simple tense.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It's usually a good idea to use the passive e.g. 'At the final stage, the product <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is delivered</span> to shops' (because we don't need to know who delivered the product).</li>

	<p>
				<p>Line graphs always show changes over time. Here's some advice about how to describe them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Try to write 4 paragraphs - introduction, summary of main points, 2 detail paragraphs.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>For your summary paragraph, look at the "big picture" - what changes happened to all of the lines from the beginning to the end of the period shown (i.e. from the first year to the last). Is there a trend that all of the lines follow (e.g. an overall increase)?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You don't need to give numbers in your summary paragraph. Numbers are specific details. Just mention general things like 'overall change', 'highest' and 'lowest', without giving specific figures.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Never describe each line separately. The examiner wants to see comparisons.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If the graph shows years, you won't have time to mention all of them. The key years to describe are the first year and the last year. You should also mention any 'special' years (e.g. a peak or a significant rise/fall).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Start describing details (paragraph 3) with a comparison of the lines for the first year shown on the graph (e.g. In 1990, the number of...).</li>

				<p><em><strong>The table below shows the proportion of different categories of families living in poverty in Australia in 1999.</strong></em></p>

<p>The table gives information about poverty rates among six types of household in Australia in the year 1999.</p>
<p>It is noticeable that levels of poverty were higher for single people than for couples, and people with children were more likely to be poor than those without. Poverty rates were considerably lower among elderly people.</p>
<p>Overall, 11% of Australians, or 1,837,000 people, were living in poverty in 1999. Aged people were the least likely to be poor, with poverty levels of 6% and 4% for single aged people and aged couples respectively.</p>
<p>Just over one fifth of single parents were living in poverty, whereas only 12% of parents living with a partner were classed as poor. The same pattern can be seen for people with no children: while 19% of single people in this group were living below the poverty line, the figure for couples was much lower, at only 7%.</p>

<p><em><strong>Here's my band 9 essay. I focused on describing similarities and differences.<br></strong></em></p>
<p>The map shows two potential locations (S1 and S2) for a new supermarket in a town called Garlsdon.</p>
<p>The main difference between the two sites is that S1 is outside the town, whereas S2 is in the town centre. The sites can also be compared in terms of access by road or rail, and their positions relative to three smaller towns.</p>
<p>Looking at the information in more detail, S1 is in the countryside to the north west of Garlsdon, but it is close to the residential area of the town. S2 is also close to the housing area, which surrounds the town centre.</p>
<p>There are main roads from Hindon, Bransdon and Cransdon to Garlsdon town centre, but this is a no traffic zone, so there would be no access to S2 by car. By contrast, S1 lies on the main road to Hindon, but it would be more difficult to reach from Bransdon and Cransdon. Both supermarket sites are close to the railway that runs through Garlsdon from Hindon to Cransdon.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Sometimes (quite rarely) you have to describe a map for IELTS Writing Task 1. Today I'll explain how I would answer this type of question.</p>
<p><em><strong>The map below is of the town of Garlsdon. A new supermarket (S) is planned for the town. The map shows two possible sites for the supermarket.</strong></em></p>
<p><a href="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c01347fbc3651970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Picture 7" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c01347fbc3651970c " src="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c01347fbc3651970c-450wi" style="width: 450px;"></a></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-size: 11px;">(From Cambridge IELTS 5)</span></p>
<p>Here is some advice:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Introduction</strong> - Just paraphrase the question (instead of 'two possible sites' you could write 'two potential locations').</li>
<li><strong>Summary</strong> - The main point is that the first site (S1) is outside the town, whereas the second site is in the town centre. Also, you could mention that the map shows the position of both sites relative to a railway and three roads which lead to three smaller towns.</li>
<li><strong>Details (2 paragraphs)</strong> - Don't write a separate paragraph about each site; it's much better to compare the sites. I'd write one paragraph comparing the position of each site relative to Garlsdon (mention the different areas of the town), and another paragraph about the positions relative to transport links with the other three towns.</li>

<p><strong>New Zealand and Australia</strong><br>The figures for New Zealand an Australia fluctuated between 40,000 and 100,000 prisoners, although New Zealand's prison population tended to be the higher of the two.</p>
<p><strong>Great Britain</strong><br>In contrast to the figures for the other countries, the number of prisoners in Great Britain rose steadily between 1930 and 1980, reaching a peak of about 80,000 at the end of the period.</p>

<li>The research is most relevant to the IELTS writing test, especially task 2.</li>
<li>Students who rush to start writing often get into trouble: their essays lack organisation, and they often forget to answer all parts of the question.</li>
<li>Students who take some time to plan their essays often get higher scores. Their essays contain more relevant ideas and better vocabulary.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, try to be more like the professors and PhD students: spend some time thinking and making notes before you start writing. Planning is the key to better writing.</p>

				<p>The other day I read about some interesting research which compared physics professors and PhD students (experts) with physics undergraduates (not experts). The professors, PhD students and undergraduates were all given the same physics test.</p>
<p>Here's a summary of the research findings:</p>
<p>"Professors and PhDs were slower than undergraduates to begin to solve the problems. The experts paused before they put pencil to paper. They spent a few minutes assessing the structure of the problem and figuring out the best physics principle to use. The undergraduates, on the other hand, jumped right into problem solving, which often got them in trouble."<span style="font-size: 8pt;"><br>(<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Choke-Secrets-Reveal-Success-Failure/dp/1849016453/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1311334467&amp;sr=1-1" target="_self">Click here</a> to see the book this comes from)</span></p>

	<p>
				<p>After a short introduction, I always try to write a paragraph which summarises the main points. When there is a lot of information (like in the bar chart below), it can be difficult to select the main points.</p>
<p><strong><em>The table below shows the figures for imprisonment in five countries between 1930 and 1980.</em></strong> (The <em>y</em> axis shows numbers of prisoners in thousands)</p>

<p>Usually I look for a change from the beginning to the end of the period. However, there is no overall trend because the figures fluctuate. So, I'll talk about the highest and lowest figures instead.</p>
<p><strong>Here is my summary of the main points:</strong></p>
<p>While the figures for imprisonment fluctuated over the period shown, it is clear that the United States had the highest number of prisoners overall. Great Britain, on the other hand, had the lowest number of prisoners for the majority of the period.</p>

<li>You can talk about any type of book (textbook, biography etc.). You only need to describe a story if the question asks you to describe a 'novel'. </li>
<li>Many books are also films. It would be a good idea to prepare one description that you can use for both. </li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon.com</a> is great for reviews of books, films and music. Just search for a title, then go down the page to find the reviews. </li>
<li>"Steal" the best vocabulary from the reviews that you find. </li>
<li>Use Google. I searched for "my favourite film is" on Google and found this <a href="http://www.gumbopages.com/chuck/films.html">'My Favourite Films' website</a>. It's full of good ideas. </li>
<li>Try this Google search: "my favourite piece of music is" </li>
<li>You can describe a book, film or piece of music from your country. </li>
<li>You can invent a story if necessary, but it's easier to tell the truth. </li>
<li>If you don't like books, pretend that your favourite film is a book (and vice versa). </li>
<li>Remember to include adjectives to describe your feelings/opinions. Tell the story of when you first read the book, saw the film or listened to the song, who recommended it, why you like it etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>NB. 'Piece of music' just means a song.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Last week I wrote a lesson about summarising the information on a graph. After your summary, you then need to describe specific details. It's important to include numbers and make some comparisons.</p>
<p><a href="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c014e89cf06b6970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="6a0120a5bb05d8970c015433856124970c-800wi" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c014e89cf06b6970d" src="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c014e89cf06b6970d-800wi" title="6a0120a5bb05d8970c015433856124970c-800wi"></a></p>
<p>Try to write 2 paragraphs describing details. It looks more organised if you divide the information into 2 parts.</p>
<p><strong>For line graphs, I always use the following approach:</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1st detail paragraph</span>: compare the numbers for the first year (e.g. 1951), then describe the changes up to a key point on the graph (e.g. peak numbers in 1971).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2nd detail paragraph</span>: explain the general trend for each line after the key point (1971), then compare the numbers for the last year shown (2009).</p>

	<p>
				<p>One of the steps in yesterday's <em><strong>success</strong></em> cycle was "enjoy studying more".</p>
<p>To escape the worry cycle, try to find ways to enjoy learning English more. Maybe you could watch more videos on ted.com or YouTube. Maybe you could read a book that you have already read in your own language. If you don't find ways to make it interesting, you'll get bored, frustrated and even more worried.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Here's my full band 9 essay for <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/2011/06/ielts-writing-task-1-selecting.html" target="_self">last week's question</a>:</p>
<p>The bar chart compares consumer spending on six different items in Germany, Italy, France and Britain.</p>
<p>It is clear that British people spent significantly more money than people in the other three countries on all six goods. Of the six items, consumers spent the most money on photographic film.</p>
<p>People in Britain spent just over £170,000 on photographic film, which is the highest figure shown on the chart. By contrast, Germans were the lowest overall spenders, with roughly the same figures (just under £150,000) for each of the six products.</p>
<p>The figures for spending on toys were the same in both France and Italy, at nearly £160,000. However, while French people spent more than Italians on photographic film and CDs, Italians paid out more for personal stereos, tennis racquets and perfumes. The amount spent by French people on tennis racquets, around £145,000, is the lowest figure shown on the chart.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em><br>- I tried to keep the essay short (154 words) by selecting carefully.<br>- It's difficult to change <em>spend</em>, but I used <em>spending</em>, <em>spenders</em> and <em>paid out</em>.</p>

	<p>
				<p>When deciding whether to give a band 7 in IELTS speaking or writing, one of the things that examiners look at is your use of collocations.</p>
<p>'Collocation' basically means using the right words together. Many students know a lot of nouns, but they don't always know the right verbs to use with those nouns.</p>
<p>Here are some useful 'verb + noun' collocations:</p>
<ul>
<li>to make a mistake (not 'do' a mistake)</li>
<li>to do/carry out/conduct research (not 'make' research, not 'a' research)</li>
<li>to make/take/reach a decision</li>
<li>to have/gain/lack experience</li>
<li>to have/face/experience difficulties</li>
</ul>
<p>Think about this, especially when you are writing essays. Check in a dictionary to make sure you have used the right verb with the right noun.</p>

	<p>
				<p>The following bar chart has a total of 24 bars. It's impossible to describe 24 pieces of information in only 20 minutes, so you need to <em>select</em>.</p>
<p><a href="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c015432debcdd970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Screen shot 2011-06-08 at 16.12.59" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c015432debcdd970c" src="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c015432debcdd970c-500wi" title="Screen shot 2011-06-08 at 16.12.59"></a></p>
<p>A simple rule is to select at least one key thing about each country. Here are some examples:</p>
<p><strong>Britain: </strong>highest spending on all 6 products, give the figure for photographic film.<br><strong>France:</strong> second highest for 3 products, but lowest for the other 3.<br><strong>Italy:</strong> Italians spent more money on toys than on any other product.<br><strong>Germany:</strong> lowest spending overall, similar figures for all 6 products.</p>

<p>The diagrams show how house designs differ according to climate.</p>
<p>The most noticeable difference between houses designed for cool and warm climates is in the shape of the roof. The designs also differ with regard to the windows and the use of insulation.</p>
<p>We can see that the cool climate house has a high-angled roof, which allows sunlight to enter through the window. By contrast, the roof of the warm climate house has a peak in the middle and roof overhangs to shade the windows. Insulation and thermal building materials are used in cool climates to reduce heat loss, whereas insulation and reflective materials are used to keep the heat out in warm climates.</p>
<p>Finally, the cool climate house has one window which faces the direction of the sun, while the warm climate house has windows on two sides which are shaded from the sun. By opening the two windows at night, the house designed for warm climates can be ventilated.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Students worry about how to describe diagrams, but the basic method is always the same: introduction, summary of main points, specific details.</p>
<p>Look at the following question for example:</p>
<p><em><strong>The diagrams below show some principles of house design for cool and for warm climates.</strong></em></p>

<p>Although this question is different from the normal graph/chart questions, you should structure your answer in the same way. Try to write 4 paragraphs:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Introduction:</strong> paraphrase the question.</li>
<li><strong>Summary:</strong> describe the main differences - the design of the roof and windows, and the use of insulation.</li>
<li><strong>Details:</strong> compare the roof design and use of insulation.</li>
<li><strong>Details:</strong> compare the window design and how windows are used during the day and at night.</li>

	<p>
				<p>If you want to get a high score for task 1, you must write an 'overview' of the information. An overview is a summary of the main points or general trends.</p>
<p>How would you write an overview for this graph?</p>
<p><a href="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c01538e1c9f9f970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="6a0120a5bb05d8970c014e87fc44d5970d-800wi" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c01538e1c9f9f970b image-full" src="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c01538e1c9f9f970b-800wi" title="6a0120a5bb05d8970c014e87fc44d5970d-800wi"></a></p>
<p>I try to write two sentences for my overview, so I look for two main points or trends. I don't usually mention any numbers because I save them for my 'details' paragraphs.</p>
<p><em><strong>Example overview:</strong></em></p>
<p>It is clear that Canada exported more wheat than Australia and the European Community for most of the period shown. However, while Canada's wheat exports fluctuated and Australia's fell, wheat exports from the European Community rose steadily.</p>

<p><em><strong>The diagram below shows the water cycle, which is the continuous movement of water on, above and below the surface of the Earth.</strong></em></p>

<p>The picture illustrates the way in which water passes from ocean to air to land during the natural process known as the water cycle.</p>
<p>Three main stages are shown on the diagram. Ocean water evaporates, falls as rain, and eventually runs back into the oceans again.</p>
<p>Beginning at the evaporation stage, we can see that 80% of water vapour in the air comes from the oceans. Heat from the sun causes water to evaporate, and water vapour condenses to form clouds. At the second stage, labelled ‘precipitation’ on the diagram, water falls as rain or snow.</p>
<p>At the third stage in the cycle, rainwater may take various paths. Some of it may fall into lakes or return to the oceans via ‘surface runoff’. Otherwise, rainwater may filter through the ground, reaching the impervious layer of the earth. Salt water intrusion is shown to take place just before groundwater passes into the oceans to complete the cycle.</p>

<p>The first picture shows the layout of an art gallery, and the second shows some proposed changes to the gallery space.</p>
<p>It is clear that significant changes will be made in terms of the use of floor space in the gallery. There will be a completely new entrance and more space for exhibitions.</p>
<p>At present, visitors enter the gallery through doors which lead into a lobby. However, the plan is to move the entrance to the Parkinson Court side of the building, and visitors will walk straight into the exhibition area. In place of the lobby and office areas, which are shown on the existing plan, the new gallery plan shows an education area and a small storage area.</p>
<p>The permanent exhibition space in the redeveloped gallery will be about twice as large as it is now because it will occupy the area that is now used for temporary exhibitions. There will also be a new room for special exhibitions. This room is shown in red on the existing plan and is not currently part of the gallery.</p>

<p><a href="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c014e5fc3ca01970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Diag_water_cycle" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c014e5fc3ca01970c image-full" src="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c014e5fc3ca01970c-800wi" title="Diag_water_cycle"></a></p>
<p>Here are some tips:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Introduction:</strong> Paraphrase the question. You could use the words 'natural process'.</li>
<li><strong>Summary:</strong> Say how many steps there are, and mention the first and last steps. You can choose where the cycle begins, but I'd start from the ocean.</li>
<li><strong>Details (2 paragraphs):</strong> Describe the process step by step. You don't have to mention every word shown on the diagram, so don't worry if you don't understand 'salt water intrusion'.</li>
<li><strong>No conclusion:</strong> It's a description, so there is nothing to conclude.</li>
</ol>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em><br>Verbs will be active, not passive e.g. "water evaporates", not "water is evaporated".</p>

<p>The table shows data about the underground rail networks in six major cities.</p>
<p>The table compares the six networks in terms of their age, size and the number of people who use them each year. It is clear that the three oldest underground systems are larger and serve significantly more passengers than the newer systems.</p>
<p>The London underground is the oldest system, having opened in 1863. It is also the largest system, with 394 kilometres of route. The second largest system, in Paris, is only about half the size of the London underground, with 199 kilometres of route. However, it serves more people per year. While only third in terms of size, the Tokyo system is easily the most used, with 1927 million passengers per year.</p>
<p>Of the three newer networks, the Washington DC underground is the most extensive, with 126 kilometres of route, compared to only 11 kilometres and 28 kilometres for the Kyoto and Los Angeles systems. The Los Angeles network is the newest, having opened in 2001, while the Kyoto network is the smallest and serves only 45 million passengers per year.</p>

<p>At the fourth stage in the process, the clay bricks are placed in a drying oven for one to two days. Next, the bricks are heated in a kiln at a moderate temperature (200 - 900 degrees Celsius) and then at a high temperature (up to 1300 degrees), before spending two to three days in a cooling chamber. Finally, the finished bricks are packaged and delivered.</p>

				<p>Here is my full essay for a question about 4 pie charts.</p>
<p><em><strong>Cambridge IELTS book 7, page 101:</strong></em></p>
<p>The pie charts compare the amount of electricity produced using five different sources of fuel in two countries over two separate years.</p>
<p>Total electricity production increased dramatically from 1980 to 2000 in both Australia and France. While the totals for both countries were similar, there were big differences in the fuel sources used.</p>
<p>Coal was used to produce 50 of the total 100 units of electricity in Australia in 1980, rising to 130 out of 170 units in 2000. By contrast, nuclear power became the most important fuel source in France in 2000, producing almost 75% of the country’s electricity.</p>
<p>Australia depended on hydro power for just under 25% of its electricity in both years, but the amount of electricity produced using this type of power fell from 5 to only 2 units in France. Oil, on the other hand, remained a relatively important fuel source in France, but its use declined in Australia. Both countries relied on natural gas for electricity production significantly more in 1980 than in 2000.</p>

<li><strong><em>While</em></strong> and <strong><em>whilst</em></strong> are the same, but <strong><em>whilst</em></strong> is a bit more formal (according to one famous grammar book).</li>
<li><strong><em>Whereas</em></strong> is always used for contrast. <strong><em>While/whilst</em></strong> can be used for contrast, OR to mean "at the same time".</li>

<p>Don't overuse these words. Although they can be useful, you should not begin every sentence with one of them. Use them occasionally.</p>
<p>Remember, all IELTS students learn linking words like 'moreover', so examiners are not impressed by them. If you want to impress the examiner, you need to use good vocabulary related to the question topic.</p>

<p>The chart gives information about UK immigration, emigration and net migration between 1999 and 2008.</p>
<p>Both immigration and emigration rates rose over the period shown, but the figures for immigration were significantly higher. Net migration peaked in 2004 and 2007.</p>
<p>In 1999, over 450,000 people came to live in the UK, while the number of people who emigrated stood at just under 300,000. The figure for net migration was around 160,000, and it remained at a similar level until 2003. From 1999 to 2004, the immigration rate rose by nearly 150,000 people, but there was a much smaller rise in emigration. Net migration peaked at almost 250,000 people in 2004.</p>
<p>After 2004, the rate of immigration remained high, but the number of people emigrating fluctuated. Emigration fell suddenly in 2007, before peaking at about 420,000 people in 2008. As a result, the net migration figure rose to around 240,000 in 2007, but fell back to around 160,000 in 2008.</p>

				<p>Last week I looked at how to use the word 'because'. One of my students then asked me to explain the difference between 'because' and 'because of'.</p>
<p>Compare these two sentences:</p>
<p>I stayed at home <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">because</span> the weather <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">was</span> bad.<br>I stayed at home <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">because of</span> the bad weather.</p>
<p>The important difference is the use of the word 'was' in the first sentence. After 'because', you need a subject and a verb (e.g. the weather was). After 'because of', we don't use a verb, only a noun, nouns or noun phrase.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Many students are waiting to find the 'secret' to the IELTS test. They try different books, websites, teachers and even different test centres in their search for the answer. They spend a lot of time worrying.</p>
<p>Other students just do an hour or two of hard work every day. They read newspapers and watch TV or online videos, they keep a notebook for vocabulary, they gradually prepare themselves rather than doing tests all the time, they do their homework, and they try to learn from their mistakes.</p>

<p>The three bar charts show average years of schooling, numbers of scientists and technicians, and research and development spending in developing and developed countries. Figures are given for 1980 and 1990.</p>
<p>It is clear from the charts that the figures for developed countries are much higher than those for developing nations. Also, the charts show an overall increase in participation in education and science from 1980 to 1990.</p>
<p>People in developing nations attended school for an average of around 3 years, with only a slight increase in years of schooling from 1980 to 1990. On the other hand, the figure for industrialised countries rose from nearly 9 years of schooling in 1980 to nearly 11 years in 1990.</p>
<p>From 1980 to 1990, the number of scientists and technicians in industrialised countries almost doubled to about 70 per 1000 people. Spending on research and development also saw rapid growth in these countries, reaching $350 billion in 1990. By contrast, the number of science workers in developing countries remained below 20 per 1000 people, and research spending fell from about $50 billion to only $25 billion.</p>

	<p>
				<p>How do you answer a task 1 question that has more than one chart or graph?</p>
<p>Here's my advice:</p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>Write your introduction in the usual way: paraphrase the question. For this kind of question, it's easier to write 2 sentences e.g. "The first chart illustrates... The second chart shows..."</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong><br>Write a paragraph describing the main points. If possible, try to summarise all of the information, rather than writing a separate summary for each chart. Look for a topic or trend that links the charts.</p>
<p><strong>Details</strong><br>Describe each chart separately. Just write a short paragraph about each chart. Choose the most important information from each one.</p>

	<p>
				<p>Last week I suggested an essay structure for the following question:</p>

<p><em><strong>The diagram below shows how the Australian Bureau of Meteorology collects up-to-the-minute information on the weather in order to produce reliable forecasts.</strong></em></p>

<p>
<a href="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c0133f432ca94970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Weather Forecast" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a0120a5bb05d8970c0133f432ca94970b " src="http://ielts-simon.com/.a/6a0120a5bb05d8970c0133f432ca94970b-500wi" title="Weather Forecast"></a></p>

<p><em><strong>Here is my full essay (170 words):</strong></em></p>

<p>The figure illustrates the process used by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology to forecast the weather.</p>

<p>There are four stages in the process, beginning with the collection of information about the weather. This information is then analysed, prepared for presentation, and finally broadcast to the public.</p>

<p>Looking at the first and second stages of the process, there are three ways of collecting weather data and three ways of analysing it. Firstly, incoming information can be received by satellite and presented for analysis as a satellite photo. The same data can also be passed to a radar station and presented on a radar screen or synoptic chart. Secondly, incoming information may be collected directly by radar and analysed on a radar screen or synoptic chart. Finally, drifting buoys also receive data which can be shown on a synoptic chart.</p>

<p>At the third stage of the process, the weather broadcast is prepared on computers. Finally, it is delivered to the public on television, on the radio, or as a recorded telephone announcement.</p><p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em><br>I've also sent a full essay version of yesterday's task 2 lesson to everyone who has bought the <a href="http://ielts-simon.com/ielts-help-and-english-pr/ielts-ebook.html">ebook</a>. </p>

				<p>A 'process diagram' is any diagram that shows steps or stages in a process. Many students worry about this type of question, but they are really quite easy if you know what to do.</p>

<p>Look at the following example from Cambridge IELTS 1, page 51:</p>

	<p>
				<p>Some students get angry with the IELTS exam. They disagree with the exam format, or they think that examiners are too strict. They often want to suggest their own improvements.</p>

<p>I completely understand that such an important exam can be frustrating, and I agree that the IELTS exam is not perfect. However, I also think that too much worrying is a waste of time.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the exam is what it is. We have to accept that, and work hard to overcome the difficulties. You <em><strong>will</strong></em> pass the exam if you apply yourself, follow advice, and study hard.</p>

<li>There was a sharp fall in Internet usage. (noun)</li>

	<p>
				<p>The essay below is 151 words long. I've tried to make it as simple as possible, but it's still good enough to get a band 9.</p>

<p>The line graph compares the percentage of people in three countries who used the Internet between 1999 and 2009.</p>
<p>It is clear that the proportion of the population who used the Internet increased in each country over the period shown. Overall, a much larger percentage of Canadians and Americans had access to the Internet in comparison with Mexicans, and Canada experienced the fastest growth in Internet usage.</p>
<p>In 1999, the proportion of people using the Internet in the USA was about 20%. The figures for Canada and Mexico were lower, at about 10% and 5% respectively. In 2005, Internet usage in both the USA and Canada rose to around 70% of the population, while the figure for Mexico reached just over 25%.</p>
<p>By 2009, the percentage of Internet users was highest in Canada. Almost 100% of Canadians used the Internet, compared to about 80% of Americans and only 40% of Mexicans.</p>

<ul>
<li>Look for the overall trend from left to right on the graph. Is there a change from the first year to the last year?</li>
<li>Do the lines on the graph follow a similar trend, or can you see any differences?</li>

	<p>
				<p>The introduction to an IELTS writing task 1 essay should explain what the chart/graph shows. To do this, just paraphrase the question (rewrite it in your own words).</p>

<p>Here is an example description from an IELTS Task 1 question:</p>

<p><strong>The graph below shows the proportion of the population aged 65 and over between 1940 and 2040 in three different countries.</strong></p>

<p>By rewriting this description with a few changes, I can quickly create a good introduction:</p>

<p><strong>The line graph compares the percentage of people aged 65 or more in three countries over a period of 100 years.</strong></p>

<p>If you practise this technique, you will be able to write task 1 introductions very quickly. You will be able to start the writing test quickly and confidently.</p>

<p>To help you think about how to describe the map, answer these questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>How could you paraphrase "the map shows the development of the village"?</li>
<li>How many periods of development are shown, and which period saw the most development?</li>
<li>What is the relationship between transport and the growth of the village?</li>
<li>How could you group the information in order to write <span style="text-decoration: underline;">two</span> 'specific details' paragraphs?</li>
</ol>
